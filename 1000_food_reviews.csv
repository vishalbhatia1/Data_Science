"Bergamot is reminiscent of orange or lemon extract, but with it's own particular personality.  It is a delicious substitute for lemon flavoring in teas and cookies. It makes a nice cologne, too."
These are the best chocolate covered coffee beans that I have ever had.  They are very fresh and very tasty.  I ordered a pound for my mother in law.
"I love these cinnamon candies.  They are not the same as the cinnamon disks or imperials.  Much better!  I am having trouble finding them.  Was able to get the 2# bag at Wal-Mart but the last two times I have been there, they have not had any."
Seems Brach's is doing away with this mint which is a shame.  By far the best Cinnamon mint on the market.
"I love the Brach's Star Brites Cinnamon Mints.  However, I always bought them at WalMart for approximately $2.99 per bag.  I can't buy them again at the price I paid.  Why were they at least $15.00 more per bag.  I find that unconsionable.  You asked me for my opiniion now I would like your answer to my opinion.  Thank you."
"Have always kept these available at work, a lot of disappointed people there now. The very best cinnamon candy on the market, well it use to be. Hope Brach's will bring them back!"
"I quit smoking 6 1/2 years ago and these Brach's cinnamon disks have been a staple in my house. I, too, was buying the 2# bags at Walmart, who has stopped carrying them at all.  One local grocery store has the smaller bags, one.  And if they sell out, I am left scrounging for knockoffs which are nothing like the Brach's brand.Please, Brach's, do not discontinue."
"These are wonderful ""desk"" candies...everyone who stops by takes at least one. Spicy but not too hot. The problem is finding them. As another reviewer stated, I used to find them at Wal Mart but haven't in a while. I just WILL NOT pay $16.50 plus shipping for 2# of candy as listed by one seller here on Amazon. Yes, they are good, but whoa...I MIGHT pay $8/pound for some good fudge or really fine chocolates, but not for a plain hard candy like this."
"We had been looking for a long time for a decent decaf black tea to have in the afternoon and evenings. Tried this Typhoo on a whim. After a long search of tasting no flavour decafs, we were elated to find this robust and lovely. We are very pleased that the search is over!"
This is so flavorful and decaf! This is the best decaf on the market. I would usually use 2 decaf bags just to have color in my tea.  Typhoo just one round bag does the trick.  You will not be disappointed.
"I buy this in the UK but it is wonderful to know I can get it here if supplies run low between trips! I recommend steeping the bag for several minutes, then adding milk and sugar to taste. It has been a lifesaver during cold and flu season. I prefer it to PG Tips, which I find to be quite bitter. Typhoo has a much smoother taste."
"I love this tea...in fact it is the only hot drink I drink and I have ordered it several times but I won't again!Several of the bags are torn...when you open the silver foil pack...always very careful when I do...you can see small tears in many of the bags and of course the tea is leaking out.I have never had this happen before...and I always buy this brand.  So either this was a bad ""batch"" or the quality control is slipping.Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I gave up caffeine ten years ago. I spent months and months trying to find a decaf black tea that actually had flavor or didn't taste like seaweed. (Seriously. Lipton decaf tastes fishy.) I finally found a few brands that were fantastic. Decaf PG Tips is solid. But decaf Typhoo is, by far, the best decaf tea I'ver ever tasted. In fact, it's the only decaf brand I will purchase.If you've been disappointed with decaf teas, give Typhoo a try. You'll be shocked at its strong, full-bodied flavor.Having said that, these days, to save cash, I usually make my own decaf tea. Turns out something like 90% of the caffeine in a regular tea bag is released in the first 30 seconds of brewing time. So, if I want a cup of tea late at night I heat enough water for two cups, brew the bag for 30 seconds in the first cup then toss that stuff and drop the now-decaffeinated bag in the fresh hot water.But I always keep some decaf Typhoo on hand when I don't have the patience to make my own decaf tea."
This tea is difficult to find and is fantastic.  Highly recommend it.  Good service from the vendor.
In England babies have this mixed with their milk formula and then in the younger years its customary to drink cups of this nectar. YAHOO TYPHOO!
I live in Japan and it is little difficult for me to getdecaffeinated tea bag here.I sent it to my brother's address.It is really helpful to find this kind of stuff on the amazon.com!
"I have to drink decaf tea in the evenings and before I found this Typhoo I always had to trade off decent tasting tea for being able to sleep at night. But Typhoo decaf makes a very robust and flavorful pot of tea. On more than one occasion, somebody in the family has grabbed this decaf by mistake and nobody even realized it was decaf until we noticed the distinctive round bag in the bottom of the pot. This tea is best brewed by the pot using fully boiling water. If you try to make it by the individual cup using 190 degree water or water heated in a microwave, you'll probably be disappointed. Besides compromising the flavor, brewing by the cup would be wasteful since a single bag makes a good three cups of tea. The only compromise needed when brewing this decaf over regular black tea is the decaf needs to steep a bit longer (I'd say ten minutes) for maximum flavor. Alternatively, you can limit the water to two cups and then it's ready in about six minutes. Typhoo also makes regular caffeinated black tea which I consider to be just average."
Hard to find a decaf tea with such great flavor and strength.Typhoo is terrific.I've tried a number of different decaf teas and this is undoubtedly one of the best.
I really liked this tea an have no complaint about it... like the extra leaf taste in it kinda makes it a little stronger tasting tea an not water tating
"In my hunt for good strong decaf, I've tried many. This is the best, alongside Tetley. I actually drink a 14 ounce cup in the morning using one bag of Tetley decaf and one bag of Ty-phoo. One would be hard pressed to guess it was full decaf. I'm throwing out my PG Tips. After forty-or-so cups, I've given it a good trial, but it's just too ""green"" for me. Sticking with this one...just placed another order. Ty-phoo is strong, with no weird designer tea flavors added, and no off-tastes. As close to the caffeinated tea you really want to drink as you will get."
"This is a great tea on the strong side which is just the way I like it.  I will drink this cold or hot and love the tase.  I sometimes combine it with green tea to get the benefits of the black and green teas together!  A true English tasting tea.  If you enjoy strong, full-bodied, teas you will love Ty-phoo!  The decaf does not take away from the flavor.  You will not be disappointed!  One bag will brew 2 cups of tea easily!"
"Very nice company to work with.  My first shipment was damaged and they immediately overnighted me a new order.<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000CCYVTC"">PG Tips 80 Tea Bags</a>"
"(I'm in Arkansas, not Argentina)Typhoo tea is a traditionally British blend and the Decaf version won't dissapoint you. Assam tea is a large part of the blend which adds the ""maltiness"" and mouth feel that drinkers of Irish and Scottish Breakfast teas enjoy. I never drink this type of tea without milk and it was blended to be enjoyed that way. These are larger teabags than you'll find with Twinings or Bigalow brands of ""breakfast"" tea. I've been a tea lover for 35 years and spent many years in the UK drinking all kinds of teas, my daily black tea is Typhoo Decaf because :- a water based meathod decaffeinates the tea, no chemicals are ever used- Typhoo has a full flavor of malty Assam lightened with Ceylon (compared to PG Tips which is lighter on Assam, less malty)- the round teabags are designed to filter the maximume flavor from the tea- 1 teabag makes a heafty 12oz mug or slightly lighter 14oz pot of tea- it's a great cuppa any time of day because there's minimal caffeine (average caffeine in Decaf teas is barely 5mg)- if I over-steep this tea it doesn't get bitterCheck prices around the web and you'll find that Amazon offers the best deal, especially when there's Free Shipping !Typhoo Decaf gets you through the day and makes a relaxing cup before bed. It's the kind of tea you'd be served with rich biscuits and teacakes throughout the UK. if you like a heafty cup of tea with milk this Decaf will take care of you.NOTE : I always check the expiration dates on the boxes when they arrive to be sure a seller hasn't sold me outdated tea. This has only happened once and the seller is no longer on Amazon."
"As a Soldier we work crazy hours, this product keeps you hydrated and energized ready to accomplish any mission.  Thank you MIO!"
"So, basically my morning routine is, wake up, go to work, buy an orange flavor Rockstar, and work; 5 times per week.I spend exactly 2.50 per can of Rockstar. The caffeine i get from it is mentally required for me, i can't function as well without having one.I saw these bottles at Ralphs for about $3.something. I bought this black cherry flavor, which packs 60mg of caffeine per 1/2 tbsp. Yikes! :)So, my routine now is, wake up, go to work, add some flavor to my water, and get to work.Assuming i drink 5 Rockstar's per week: $12.50The MIO black cherry container says it makes 18 8fl oz mixes but it depends on how many squirts you put. The regular water bottles are 16.9 fl oz. I think i can get at least 10 water bottles out of each little MIO.So, (10 approx. bottles * $0.25 approx cost of bottled water) + ($4 MIO) / (5 work days) =  around $6 dollars.If i want to save money, and reduce my overall costs of $13+ per week for energy drinks, I have to count on something with the same amount of kick (caffeine).This stuff has to work for me, and it has, so i recommend it.At least now i will be drinking water + enhancer."
I have a soda machine that is great!  These little bottles hold a lot of flavor that work great with the soda machine and they take up very little room.  Love the Cherry and Orange/Tangerine!
"My husband and I recently had sushi at a fantastic restaurant in Annapolis, MD. called Joss. The server suggested that I try this wine with my sushi, so I did. It was so perfect. The wine is light and has a bright clean flavor, kind of cleans your pallette as you eat. I'm no expert, but was really pleasantly surprised. Try it with your sushi, you won't be disappointed."
We usually have to travel to China Town to buy this product and was so happy to have found it on Amazon. It was sent to us quickly and we love this tea which is very good for us. We would order from this company again. Thanks
"I had been purchasing loose leaves from another company, but one day when they weren't available, I ordered these bags.  Blech!!  The loose leaves from Immortalitea were such a pleasant tasting product.  These bags are so pungently horrible tasting that one shudders when sipping it.  I can't get past the taste."
"If you like bitter, putrid tastes, this may be the tea for you.  The tea tastes so terrible I am sure it will be thrown out.  Gynostemma is supposed to taste good. Something is very wrong with this product.  I drink a lot of herbal teas, so I can usually tolerate new flavor."
I bought jiaogulan from multiple places and this brand doesn't taste right. It tastes bitter with no sweet aftertaste. I would not buy Sheng Tangshen Brand jiaogulan/gynostemma pentaphyllum.
I was not quite sure about the results.  I took only morning and evening.  Result was excellent.  I felt my stomach is smooth.
this tea is for medical use to lower blood pressure. it seems to have diuretic effect
What fun to find candy I loved as a child! Even more wonderful to find these old candies for my kids to enjoy in any season! To be in individual packs to eat in smaller quantities at a time is perfect!
"I could not find Nestle Crunch Crisp bars in any store in US.  I was quite happy to find them on Amazon.  The product is superb, delivery was fast and packing perfect.  Thank you!!!"
I have been a fan of these since i first saw them - can't have the old time fatty wafer and these are tasty and crisp. I don't mind buying them this way but wish the local store would have continued to order them.
"It's hard to find the 20 pack boxes locally.This is convenient and cheaper than thesmall packs. When I can find the big boxes,the price is about the same."
"Great product, great taste, but also a great ripoff at $15 when it's available at a local grocery for approx. $3.80 !"
"This product is great for a quick cup of coffee. If you use a mug I suggest that you use 2 ""sticks"". It ain't perked but it's close."
I love the flavor. It's my favorite with grape coming in a close second. It's wonderful on a hot day.
"Not mutch to say, but my wife and I are both on a diet and we are trying to drink only water.  Water gets very boring after a short time and I love this fruit punch stuff.  We keep a gallon made at all times and its pretty much all we drink.  We get it off amazon for almost half what you pay at giant eagle.  Then we sav any extra 15% for auto reorder.  Can't say enough..."
"With the summer heat, a cool drink it what hits the spot.  You could drink something like Snapple, but at such a lower cost and just as good (if not better) are these Crystal Light Drink Mixes.  The Fruit Punch is a winner!"
Delivery was very fast but the jelly beans were loose in a box and were stale.  I will never buy from this seller again.
"One star for never replying to my email in which I included a photograph of a foreign object I found in the first package (looked like a dark brown chunk of foam, along with a hair). I was very much concerned when reading the labels' country of origin that among three, included China (Somehow I doubt that Canada beat out China for pricing = most likely China). Although I'll never know for sure since they never responded to any of my questions/concerns. I wouldn't recommend this product if your concerned about food quality."
"If you like me wear and drink black, then this tea is for you. I for the most part keep cautions of fruity teas, I like my tea solid and strong. However this tea had this boldness with a twist of Apricot, which I enjoyed. It is great to break-up a routine of always just black and have some additional flavor to it, and this tea is the one."
"This oil is wonderful!  Use it to add kick to pasta or pizza.  Use regular olive oil, fresh garlic, and capers with a four or five drops of this per dish for a wonderful Italian pasta sauce."
"If you have yet to try the Zevia line of natural sodas, you're in for a real treat!  Finally, a sugar-free soda that tastes GREAT and isn't loaded with artificial chemicals and flavorings!These drinks are winners for me because they're sweetened with all-natural Stevia, which has zero glycemic affect but all the great taste of sugar... and the flavorings are natural!!  I can drink it all day without going into sugar overload!Thus far I have tried the cola, root beer, orange and the latest, Dr. Zevia... THE BEST!!  Root beer comes in a close second!!  For some reason, I like them better over crushed ice rather than straight out of the can... Seems that these sodas taste even better if they can breathe a bit (or maybe I'm just crazy!).  Either way, TRY ZEVIA, then come back and tell me how right I am!!  LOL!!"
I'm so glad to have another caffeinated choice of Zevia than just the cola. This one is obviously modeled after Dr. Pepper... I'd compare it's flavor more to Cherry Dr. Pepper. It's very yummy!
"This is not a bad flavor, but it's not a good substitute for Dr Pepper like Veggie burgers are a not a good substitute for Hamburgers.This soda has more of a cherry overtone, but very little bite and is much sweeter than diet Dr Pepper. However, by itself as a new flavor, it's really good and I still would recommend it to others."
"Sprout's was having a sale on Zevia 6 packs (I got them for $4.50 a six pack, but they were usually $5.59), so i bought cola, rootbeer, orange, twist, Dr. Zevia, and black cherry flavors. I did not buy the ginger ale as i was never really a fan of any ginger ale.As far as Dr. zevia goes, I is by far the most intense flavor, in my opinion. Too strong for me. Very very cherry...it almost tasted like cough syrup without the consistency. I ignored someone's warnings on this flavor, and now i regret wasting 5 bucks on the six pack. Im a really big diet dr. pepper fan, and Dr. zevia just didnt cut it for me. :/As far as the other flavors go:The orange one seemed a little too light in flavor. (I rate it 4/5)Black cherry was perfect for me! (5/5) Nice flavor and carbonation.Cola (5/5) and rootbeer (5/5)were good too. Cola almost tasted like Diet Rite with slightly less carbonation. Rootbeer is hard to compare to anything.The lemon lime twist one was interesting. As a sierra mist gal, i had high hopes. Unfortunately, i would give it a 3/5. It just had a funny taste to it. Hard to compare it to anything really.This is just my two cents on the flavors.I refridgerated them, so i drank them ice cold. I can't comment on the flavors when they are luke-warm."
"This soda is fantastic, I was dreaming of the day it would be made. Seriously its great. My kids love it and the best part is that it is all natural! no cancer causing benzoate- I do not feel guilty drinking this soda every now and then!"
"A long time ago I tried Zevia's Orange soda and was really disappointed.  Eventually I tried the lemon/lime flavor, which I found similarly underwhelming, but the Cola flavor was actually not bad, although not great.  I do actually quite like their Root Beer flavor though, and have been buying it for awhile now.  So just recently I finally decided to give Dr Zevia a try, after seeing it on the shelves and not expecting it to be that good (I think maybe because I associated the red packaging with the color of Jones Soda's diet cherry flavor, which I tried once and did not like at all, and which usually sits nearby at the store).  So anyway, WOW.  Root Beer is now my second favorite Zevia flavor.  When I indulge in regular sugar-sweetened soft drinks, I prefer Root Beer over Dr. Pepper.  But I now feel that Dr. Zevia is their best offering, and tastes more like the real thing and less like a ""diet drink"" than any of their other sodas.  I've been getting two six packs of their Root Beer at a time, but from now on I think I'll be buying at least one of Dr. Zevia instead.  I'm very impressed with this drink!"
"Zevia is eventually going to destroy other diet sodas once they are officially labeled as dangerous. Until then, it is a great secret. Dr. Zevia is the crown jewel. It tastes almost sugary with a complex cherry-like flavor. Get some."
"After reading all the warnings about artificial sweeteners, I found these sodas from Zevia. Nothing artificial, just with natural sweetness and no calories. We probably would have had the sweetener Stevia years ago if our domestic producers of artificial sweeteners hadn't interfered. It has been used in Japan for over thirty years."
"This is a nice, dark tea with a really rich vanilla flavor. It smells amazing. I've had other vanilla teas that smell sort of artificial, like a vanilla scented candle, and don't have a great taste, but this one smells like real vanilla and is delicious. Perfect for tea-time with cookies."
"As someone who does not drink caffeine, I am always challenged to find a great hot beverage. I picked up some of this tea on a whim because Amazon was having a special on it.  I love it.The tea is wonderfully spiced with a great aroma that makes you feel warm and cozy on a cold winter's night.  And, since it's decaf, I don't have to work about it keeping me awake."
"I love this tea.  It gives me three cups from one bag and it does not give me a horrible caffeine high!  The taste is the best Chai that I have found out of a bag, even better than the caffeinated version.  Try it."
My wife loves this tea and drinks it in the morning as a pick me up and in the evening to help relax after a hard day's work.  Buying in quantity from Amazon helped make the price very attractive.
"This is my FAVORITE tea, and the decaf version is difficult to find in stores.  Was thrilled to find it on Amazon and at a price similar to what I paid in stores previously.  The tea is lightly spicy and a bit sweet (no added sweetener needed, like other teas I also enjoy).  I also like that I can get about a cup & a half of tea out of one tea-bag (re-filling my cup after drinking the first half cup).  Tea bags are individually bagged so they are easy to take-along, too."
This tea is great!  I have been drinking it for at least a year now and never tire of it and nothing else seems to compare.  It is great with honey and a splash of milk.
"Tazo's Chai is my favorite, and decaf does not disappoint. It makes its best mug around 8 oz, though I still roll with a 12 oz. mug on occasion and though slightly weaker, is still delish - particularly if I go latte with it. Decaf Chai is my version of sleepytime tea :)"
"This is the most delicious chai tea I've found that can be purchased in a bag. Try it with milk and sugar, it's fantastic."
i loved this tea especially in winter realy its warming the whole body in cold weather
"Very good!  I like that it doesn't have any dairy, egg, peanuts, no allergens to speak of which is important to me.  The taste and texture complement any pizza pie, just as it should.  Sometimes pizza sauces containing cheese overtakes the whole pizza.  I was able to buy just 2 cans of this elsewhere to sample it.  Wish I could buy it by the case here."
"My husband and I were at Whole Foods and found this sauce and thought we should try it.  When I went to check out, it was not in the system and they just gave it to us.  It was so good, when my husband deployed, he asked me to send him some.  I went back to Whole Foods and could not find it.  I explained to them that it was not even in the system when I got it the first time and they said that it meant that they must have received it by accident then and that it is not a normal product for them to receive.  I started the hunt all over the city of Colorado Springs and it can not be found anywhere.  I was so happy to find it online and stocked up.  I received it in a timely manner and bubble wrapped individually so I was able to move it from one box to another."
"We tried this marinade on a whim. We ended up ordering a case - it's that good! We marinated boneless, skinless chicken breasts overnight and pork tenderloin - both were amazing! We gave a bottle as a gift and the people loved it as well. We will be buying more."
"This stuff is excellent on pork steaks.  My husband and I (even my kids) love this stuff.  It's got a bit of a zing, but not too much.  Just great flavor."
"I tried this and the chicken flavor for the dogs. Both flavors came in nice large sizes (22 oz instead of dinky 10-12 ounces) and the dogs love the taste/smell of it. If they like it, I'm happy too. My only complaint is that the price has roughly doubled from the time of my first order. Other items fluctuate somewhat, but an almost 100% increase makes this stuff no deal anymore. If you can find it elsewhere, or if the price goes back down, jump on it. Your dogs will, too."
"Gosh, such a big can of key ingredients that should be healthy for your beloved animal:meat by-products, soy flour, salt, added color, artificial roasted chicken flavor, sodium nitrite and then also the better stuff which you can read for yourself.It's your beloved pet and your money. I'd save both and shop for a better brand without scary ingredients."
"If you are expecting the old Fiber One cereal then you are going to be in for a surprise. This cereal tastes like regular honey cluster cereals and not like Fiber One twigs. It is really good. And it will really make you regular with its amount of fiber. Even my kids enjoyed the taste.Highly recommend, try it, you'll like it."
"In my first order, instead of sending Fiber One Honey Clusters, I got six boxes of ""Basic Four"" cereal. When I complained Amazon sent another shipment, but again, it was all Basic Four. I have given up on Amazon getting this order right and have asked for a refund."
"I think this is the best tasting cereal in the Fiber One brand. I have been eating this for breakfast for more than 3 years now. My 2-year old niece snacks on it!At 51% of daily fiber, I found this a great way to get fiber in the morning, and it helps me be regular.I does not pack a lot of calories per serving also- I think 160-170 calories per cup. I tried other fiber-rich organic/health store cereals but either they are too sugary, or taste like cardboard."
"The best cereal in the market for its fiber content, and it tastes good. I have been using this product for a few years and it has resolved many digestion digestion issues I had. Why take fiber supplement when one can eat fiber in food?"
"I've eaten regular Fiber One, but this is SO much more versatile!  Not only is it good with milk, but it's great dry as a midnight snack.  I often pour some in a bowl and eat it like chips while watching TV.My 3 year old son even likes this, which is a a HUGE plus!  He eats it with milk for breakfast, and even likes sharing a bowl with me while we watch TV after dinner.My wife is convinced she hates ""fiber cereal"", she changed her mind after I got her to try this without telling her what it is.  NOW, this is her choice for a quick breakfast.Now that I know the family likes this, I won't hesitate buying it by the case from Amazon rather than paying the higher prices for an individual box at the grocery store."
"Love this product, it tastes great and each serving has 51% of your daily needed fiber. I'd rather have a bowl of this in the morning than to use a fiber supplement. My 3 year old loves it also. Tastes great and is not full of sugar ,like many of the kiddie cereals,so I happily let him have this for breakfast. It's also cheaper on Amazon than in the store."
I am very pleased with the order. The only thing I would change is the amount of time your customers can order your products. This product is 3 months or 6 months before ordering again. I think we should be able to order when we need the item. Three months is too soon and six months is way too much time in between. Other than that the flavor and cost is great. Thank you.
"I generally like cereal with a little less sugar.  I can add my own sweetener if I want it.  Otherwise, it is a good flake type cereal with a good quantity of fiber.  It is a little low on protein compared to some cereal, but people generally add some protein by using milk.  You can add your choice of fruit (I usually like a combination of sliced banana and strawberries, and sometimes add blueberries)."
"Yummy and high fiber cereal, we like to eat it out of the box for a snack as well as with milk."
This cereal is absolutely fantastic...best fiber cereal yet that I've found.  It tastes more like I'm eating something just tasty instead of great for me.  Does wonders for the digestive health too.
"Fiber One Honey Clusters accomplishes something most other fiber-laden foods don't: It has flavour!I was originally turned on to this cereal by a nutritional website's ranking of top cereals.  Compared to other ""ultra-healthy"" cereals like the original Fiber One it may not be the healthiest but it's a nice compromise to get a little sweetness out of your ""grown-up"" food while still providing some very worthwhile health & nutritional benefits.I don't know that any kids are going to be begging their parents for this because it obviously doesn't have all the sweetness of super-sugary cereals, but it also doesn't taste like cardboard and for those of us grown-ups who still have a bit of a sweet tooth, it fills the bill.  (If you want to add a bit of extra flavour, try it with Vanilla Silk soy milk.)Also, if you're the type of person for whom a single bowl of cereal doesn't cut it hunger-wise, this may have you singing a different tune in your morning shower.  Foods high in fiber give you a greater sense of being full so naturally this cereal should be able to keep you satisfied until your next meal.One word of caution though: For those of you who have not consumed high-fiber foods or taken Metamucil as a supplement before, start small and work your way up.  It's not uncommon to experience some uncomfortable digestive consequences if you try to take in too much fiber all at once without giving your body time to adjust.  In the long-term, though, fiber is obvisouly a fantastic way to keep your digestion in tip-top shape.Since Amazon only sells cereal in bulk, I always recommend taste-testing a single box at your local grocery.  But once you know you like it, the Subscribe & Save program may just save you money AND deliver your groceries to your door!"
This is the first fiber cereal that actually tastes great. Finally an easy way to get your daily fiber. I would recommend this highly for anyone who is having trouble getting thier daily fiber.
I have been using this for about 8mos and love it. I do have a hard time finding this so I just get it on line and have it shipped. saves me gas and time and it is less then at a store when I do find it.
"Can it be?  A cerial that has ""fiber"" in it's name that I don't have to mix with another cerial just to choke down?  Yes!!  This is it!  Get your fiber in a way that is actually pleasant.  I love the 21st century!"
"To be fair to those who must have pre-packaged sweetness in their breakfast cereal I've given this three stars. For readers like myself I'd give only one star. Reviewing this cereal on its own merits, it's OK: it tastes good and contains moderate amounts of fiber and sugar.The problem that I have with this particular Fiber One product (and to an even greater degree with the caramel and raisin-cluster versions) is that it scarcely resembles in any way its namesake, original Fiber One. When my local grocery ran out of the original Fiber One, I picked up this Honey Clusters version, thinking that with 51% of one's daily fiber requirement, it would be a decent substitute for the original, which provides 57% of the daily requirement. I should have read the label more closely: the serving size on which the 51% is based is twice that for the 57% provided by the original Fiber One; in other words, one has to consume more than twice as much in volume to get the same amount of fiber. In so doing, one will also consume almost three times as many calories due to the fact that sugar is present in several forms, including honey and high-fructose corn syrup. Original Fiber One uses aspartame rather than sugar. I really don't think that General Mills should squander the good name of Fiber One on this product.It is also most disingenuous to plaster ""low fat"" across the front of the package. Of course it is low-fat! Why would a product consisting of mostly grain and sugar contain much fat (other than a small amount for leavening and to help it hold together)?!! What General Mills is trying to imply is that this cereal is not fattening, hardly the case since it contains so many calories. The calories come mostly from sugar, and it could have been worse, though; some of the sweetness is from sucralose, which, contrary to the assertion of one reviewer, has not been proved to be ""poison"" by any reputable scientific study.Amazon considers all Fiber One cereals to be part of a ""product set"" and does not allow separate reviews; this is particularly unfortunate in that almost the only thing this product has in common with original Fiber One is the name and its ownership by General Mills. So I will elaborate a little on the original product, which is what any health-conscious person should buy instead. The original Fiber One is tasty, low-calorie, and the most pleasant way I know of to get more than half one's daily requirement of fiber. Some people won't like the form and texture of original Fiber One, however; if General Mills made a Fiber One in flake format that had the same taste and nutritional value of original Fiber One, they would have a virtually perfect product."
"First time ever buying food on Amazon. My only concern was the expiration date, but regardless, I made the purchase. Anyway, package of six boxes arrived today, and they expire Aug 2012. So no worries there! This is a great deal compared to buying it at the groceries."
"When the Raisin Bran came out in the Fiber One brand, I couldn't find my Honey Clusters at grocery, Walmart, or Target stores. I spent lots of time looking; when, I decided to check Amazon.com.  I found what I needed at a better price (and delivered to my door).  Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"I happen to like most of the Fiber One cereals, but this version is AWFUL.  It has the same stiff, round flakes, but they've been coated with some kind of fake, metallic sweetener.  It's overpowering, and it literally made me sick.  If you need the fiber, I recommend Fiber One's raisin bran.  It's more naturally flavored and the raisins make it just sweet enough.  Stay away from the Honey Clusters!"
"I am not going to say that fibre products are as good as lobster, but the cereal was much bettr than I expected. Lets talk about cost, as fiber one is costly. If you need fiber, since most of us get less than half of daily requirements, and adds to alot of nasty illnesses, colon cancer, we need fiber. To to get fiber needed out of regular food items, its almost impossible. This cereal, provides about half whats needed. Whew, love that fiber. So, it provides much more good fiber and grams and so the cost is in a way less than others, that have much less fiber, and therefore is actually more expensive. Happy crunching."
I love this cereal.  The price seems a bit high.  At a supermarket I can get the same price but I can use coupons and buy when it is on sale.
"I made the mistake of eating this cereal before reading the ingredient label.  You would think with Sugar, Corn Syrup, Brown Sugar, Honey, Barley Malt Extract, and Malt Syrup it would be sweet enough.  But no, they also added Sucralose, which explains the gross aftertaste.  If you dislike artificial sweeteners, skip this cereal.  I prefer getting fiber from cereals with short lists of ingredients, with mostly things I actually can identify."
"One might think that the sugar, corn syrup, and high fructose corn syrup in this cereal would be enough. Lurking in the list of ingredients is the poisonous Sucralose. Another Fiber One cereal has Aspertame. At least now I know I have to read every label."
"Have been using Sugar Twin packlets for some time now....excellent product...use it on cereals, coffee, tea, etc.....I will continue to use it until I'm on the other side of the grass...."
I buy the Sugar Twins for my mother and she does not drink any hot or cold beverage without this product.  She cannot find it in retail grocerie and resorts to Amazon.  She could not be happier.
"Very nice sugar substitute, and great that we can get it via web purchase, since it is not available in stores.  Thanks, Amazon!"
"My mother is diabetic and will only use Sugar Twin in the individual packets. When she lived in Indiana, she could find it. But now she lives in Colorado where no stores carry it. I have ordered it from another online store, but this year they didn't have it. I checked many similar places with no luck. I even looked for it in Indiana recently during a visit. No luck. As one last try--not expecting success--I checked with Amazon.com. SUCCESS! Thank you so much!"
"I have enjoyed sugar twin since my mother first sent it to me in a care package while I was stationed in germany back in 1974 due to my weight and the military rules on weight control, it helped ne to maintain a level of weight that was acceptable to the miltary.  I love it and have to order as no commercial or military facility in the area of the U.S. that I live in has it available. No after taste as with some of the other products that are sugar substitutes."
"For years Sugar Twin had been available in most supermarkets but over the last few years I could no longer find it. A friend suggested that I try Amazon.com. To my delight, I found it and ordered it. It's a product that does not contain any potentially harmful ingredients that some sweeteners contain. Thank you, Amazon.com."
This is a hard item to find. Not all stores sell it so when I found this online I was ecstatic. I ordered a bunch but now I see it may not be available again. I hope they will get it back in stock.
"Although both Sugar Twin and Sweet and Low both use saccharine, Sugar Twin has a much better taste."
"This has been my favorite tea for a number of years. I love it hot or cold, but most of the time I drink it cold. When making it by the glass I take a tall iced tea glass, fill it with very cold spring water and add 2 Raspberry Zinger tea bags. In a couple of minutes I have iced raspberry tea! I drink it unsweetened sometimes but other times I add a little bit of liquid stevia (a natural sweetener found in health food stores that does not have any calories & does not affect your blood sugar) and it is delicious. I sometimes add some fresh squeezed lemon or lime juice. Sometimes I add 6-8 tea bags to a gallon of spring water and make the tea in the fridge. I love to bring a gallon of it to the homes of friends and family when we visit. My sister-in-law recently asked me what brand of tea it was because they had made some iced raspberry herbal tea and it did not taste good like the one I make. I told her it was Celestial Seasons Raspberry Zinger. You can make any flavor of their teas iced by just adding the tea bags to cold water. My husband likes it also! I love it hot too. Everyone has their own tastes, but everyone that I give it to iced thinks it tastes really good.I have even used it to dye some doll's clothes for an antiqie doll some years ago. Teas can be used as a natural dye source."
"Raspberry Tea is one of my favorites.  I love tea, and I love raspberry.  This tea has a rich, strong raspberry flavor - but not too strong - it is just right.Icy raspberry tea is perfect.  I put the bags in my water bottle with water, put it in the freezer until ice shards start to form.  It is perfect and delightful."
"I've liked this tea for a long time and was very pleased to find it in 6 packs on amazon. It has a very nice flavor, unlike many fruit teas that just smell like fruit and don't taste like much of anything. It's a very pleasant sort of sweet and tart taste. I don't put sugar or anything in it. Also, when brewed, it's a deep raspberry pink color and smells wonderful! I would highly recommend this if you enjoy fruit and/or berry herbal teas!"
"My wife and I toured the Celestial Seasonings factory last month, and we are now HOOKED on the Raspberry Zinger Tea. I prefer mine chilled, while she likes it warm, but either way it is delicious!"
I know it is October and summer is officially over but this tea is good year round. Now it is sweetened with stevia but I think it is not quite sweet enough so I add another packet of stevia. The main flavors in this tea are hibiscus and raspberry. I don't taste much of the roasted chicory or orange peel. This also has blackberry leaves and rasberry leaves but you'd never know it. This is caffeine free and considered an herbal tea so you can drink it day or night. All you do is steep two bags and then pour the tea over ice. Add more sweetener if needed.~The Rebecca Review
"While some may like the sweet cloying taste of raspberry tea, and I've tried it, what I like most about this version of raspberry tea is that it's tangy and sour. I add a packet of Splenda to my morning Raspberry Red Zinger tea and the combination is just right:  not too sour and not too sweet in other words perfect.What I also love about this tea is doesn't contain caffeine meaning I can cut back on the caffeine I've been drinking. I love black tea both iced or hot so it's nice to have a tasty alternative as I can drink the Raspberry Zinger tea instead.Recommend."
I love many of the Celestial Seasons teas but this is one of my favorites. I combine it one on one with their Raspberry Green Tea and get the antioxidents I desire from the Green Tea while still betting that punch of raspberry flavor that I love.
"Raspberry Zinger is fragrant and tasty, nice fruit taste without being overpowering.  I like it even with a half packet of artificial sweetener as I am diabetic.  One reviewer poo-pooed it because it was too strong...well, steep it for less time, then try it again.  Teas are wonderfully adjustable in that way.  Of course, most of us know that already!If you're in the mood for something warming with just a hint of sweetness and lots of flavor, this tea is for you."
This tea is SUPER sour....taste like lemons. It tastes nothing like tea and I don't taste any raspberries. Very disappointed. Raspberry gardens is SO MUCH BETTER.UPDATE: Oh how wrong I was. I thought this tea was disgusting and put it in the back of my cupboard to never try again. Thankfully I tried it again today and made it into an iced tea and sweetened it. It's now my favorite tea. Now I know where all the positive reviews are coming from.
"THIS RASPBERRY ZINGER TEA IS LIGHTER THAN THE WILDBERRY ZINGER BY JUST A BIT AND IS VERY REFRESHING AND DELICIOUS.  I  USE 7 BAGS IN MY MR COFFEE ICED TEA MAKER AND IT THE PITCHER OF TEA TURNS OUT PERFECT!  I WILL BE SURE TO TRY ALL THE OTHER CELESTIAL SEASONS ZINGER TEAS, BUT SO FAR THE WILD BERRY ZINGER IS GREAT AND THIS RASPBERRY ZINGER IS EVEN BETTER, AS I AM PARTIAL TO RASPBERRIES."
"So far, I have thoroughly enjoyed all of the teas in the ""zinger"" series.  I like Celestial Seasonings in general.  Of course, the tea bags have no strings and that is something of an annoyance, but other than that, the teas are tasty and enjoyable.  Zinger really is a great description of the product.  It has a surprising and deeply flavorful taste and an aroma to match.  The lemon has a fresh, rich lemon flavor.  The raspberry embodies the flavor of raspberry as well.  It is a great option for those who enjoy herbal teas."
"I am very pleased. This is the brand I use regularly, so, the huge savings was very much appreciated. I urge anyone to try this via amazon and save $."
"My Wife & I really enjoy making ""SUN Tea"" using this tea! It has a refreshing flavor on hot summer afternoon OR ANY TIME. We make 10 cups at a time in a glass jug and the SUN does the work and enhances the fruit flavor of this tea. You can't beat the deal at Amazon either."
"Wonderful product.  Lowers blood pressure especially for diabetics.  Tastes really good.  I make a pitcher of 8 cups, keep it in the fridge and drink it instead of clear water."
"When I first brewed the tea bag, I was amazed by the deep red color and invigorating fragrance. The tea was very sweet and I didn't need to add sugar or milk. After taking a few sips however, and relatively enjoying the rasperry taste, the flavors began to become sickeningly sweet--a bit too fruity. There isn't very much ""tea"" flavor here-mostly just fruit flavor. It's worth a try, and I believe that a more experienced tea drinker would appreciate this unique blend."
"My son is 10 months old and adores Fruit Medley by Gerber.  There are very small chunks mixed in so your baby can start to chew and get used to more solid foods.  Fruit Medley is a mix of peaches, grapes, pineapple, banana, and orange.  A great start for babies beginning to eat more solid foods!"
A nice blend of several different fruits. This stage 3 food was tasty. Not as thick as some other stage threes and there are no bites or chunks. It is more like a thin custard. My son always loved this.
Rarely find the baby fruit I used to make a Baby Food Cake so ordered it fom Amazon...came very promptly and now I have plenty to make several cakes.  Good deal!  Pat Thompson
But VERY delicious just the same. If you're looking for a wee bit of a different flavor in the old favorite Oreo -- this is just what you're looking for! LOVE the size of the mini's too.
"I ordered this to make cocoa syrup (I used half this stuff and half dutch process cocoa powder)-- it turned into a concoction ""so dark, light cannot escape from its surface"".No, no, I didn't burn it.The syrup was so rich I could only use a teaspoon or two at a time, because the flavor of the cocoa is so powerful. It kept for over two years in the fridge with some crystallization. It's perfect for making hot cocoa or mocha."
This was the first time I used this product and the cake I made turned out perfect.  I used this recipe: [...]  The only thing I did differently was use a rectangular pan and baked it for ten minutes later.  I refrigerated the cake overnight and the next day had the BEST dark chocolate cake ever.  Everyone who tried it said it was absolutely amazing.  I am definitely going to purchase Black Onyx Cocoa Powder again as well as discover more recipes.
"I love this product. It has a sweet tangy flavor. I like to pour it over chicken, or fish prior to cooking. I also heat it up and pour it over rice. I add it to homemade chili. It adds a delicious flavor to foods. While it is a little pricey, it can go a long way when added to foods."
My dog absolutly LOVES these bones. They last for a relativly long time compared to rawhides. I love that these are all natural. A great bone for all dogs.
"I thought this would be a hard bone that he would simply chew off the meaty bits and then gnaw on over time.  Instead, he chewed it to pieces in no more than 20 minutes.  Then he spent the next couple days throwing up chunks of bone. My boxer is not an aggressive chewer but this bone is soft and can easily be broken down...no ""hours of enjoyment for your pet."" I normally watch closer when he's chewing something that he can break up but I thought I had nothing to fear with the bone.I wish the packaging had been clearer about the nature of the bone.  However, I am am glad it is made in the US.In the meantime I'll stick to good ol' soup bones and antlers for him to gnaw on and I'll pay closer attention as he chews on something new."
"The local stores refused to sell them about 10 years ago, I have been looking for them since!! YAY AMAZON CARRIES THEM!"
"This product came in a timely manner and was still good when it got here. The only complaint I have is that the sell by date is in 20 days. I thought I'd have longer then that to eat them. Oh well, it just means they're breakfast along with snack time. Taste very good, just like I'd expect."
"EkoJava is such a young company, I basically shut my eyes and hoped for the best when I purchased the French Roast packets for my team.  Well, they showed up in a nice container and they're in very simple - convenient - unmarked white tube packets (type of flavor is stamped on them).  They're FRESH ground coffee, can make more than one cup in a coffee maker, and are CHEAPER than Starbucks who charges $9 for a 10pc INSTANT box of coffee.......I bought my French Roast & Sumatra at 25pcs for $11.99 each!So far the team has used their packets in a regular coffee maker and one of those ""single serving"" versions.  I'm planning to buy more for Christmas as stocking stuffers."
"Great coffee.Convenient packaging.And,as  the others have said,NO plastic cups to dispose of."
When the canister arrived I thought it was really nice looking. That usually means that it's a distraction and meant to take away the focus from a mediocre product. I'm pleased to say that that is not the case!
"Very convenient, easy to use and delicious.  Much more reasonable than the K Cups and just as good.  Good prices at Amazon."
"I really like this coffee and it's super easy to fill my Silofill with it. I wish the packets were made of something else, maybe paper, so it's better for the environment!"
"I love the packaging of this product. The coffee taste great and once you learn to tap your coffee holder on the counter to settle the coffee into your 'My Cup', 'Solofill', DisposaKup or other Keurig cup, you can make some excellent coffee"
"While saving money is a key factor in purchasing this, I am basing my review on the taste of the product.  Overall, the coffee has a powdery taste as compared to the pre-packaged K-cups. It does not compare to the Tully Pre-Packaged French Roast that I am used to drinking.As noted by other reviewers, I don't know the Eco friendliness of the packaging, since you are trading out a small plastic cup for a small plastic pouch.Overall, a two star for the taste."
"My wife likes the French Roast, Honduran House Blend, West Coast Roast, Breakfast Blend, Sumatran, and then Donut Cafe in that order.  I prefer the Donut Cafe, Sumatran, French Roast, Breakfast Blend, West Coast, then Honduran.  They each have subtle differences and are a good alternative to more expensive Green Mountain (K-cups) varieties.  These tend to work better with the My K Cup (reusable filter) than Folgers or other regular coffees due to the finer grind and package size.  I paid $3.82 per 25 count container on my last order before the price went back up to $11.99 and would pay that again.  I don't think I would pay regular price however."
This is basically a medium roast coffee.  Doesn't have much flavor.  Definitely not French roast.  Even the instant Starbucks Via Italian Roast has more flavor.
I got these when I bought the Eco Brew cups so I could reach my free shipping limit. I was not expecting much but I was very surprised. Easy to tear open pack and the fill the cup to the proper level of a big cup of coffee. These are not super bold but I find they are more of a medium bold which is just right for me. I plan on ordering more as soon as I run oyt.
"I love the idea of less garbage and lower cost for Kcup coffee, but I find the water just passes through MY Kcup too fast, so it is hard to get a really strong brew which is what I prefer. The EcoJava is a great coffee just do not like the results in the kcup machine."
"I decided to try this coffee on a whim after browsing by it on Amazon. I have a Keurig single-cup brewer and have been looking for a less expensive and more environmentally friendly product than the overpriced k-cups....without giving up the flavor and quality that I like about them. The EkoJava packets fit the bill pretty well. I use them in my reusable Solofill k-cup. Each packet is just the right amount for the Solofill. I deducted 1 star because the flavor isn't quite as robust as with the actual k-cups varieties that I like, but I brew these on a smaller setting (less water) which provides more flavor in each cup. Also, it's important that you do not pack the coffee into the reusable cup too tightly or it will not brew the full amount of coffee. The grounds must have room to expand and allow the water to flow through, so you must leave the grounds as loose as possible for best results with this product! Another good thing about these packets is that the plastic pouch can be fully recycled, where as k-cups are extremely wasteful. For that reason alone, this product is worth a try, but hte flavor is great too!"
"We decided to try these because they were on sale at a very low price. Though many reviews are positive, we weren't all that thrilled with them. It seems there is even just a bit too much in each packet for filling the holder. They aren't as convenient as some of the other reviewers might lead you to believe, and there is some stuff to throw away as well. The container they come in is quite large, so we ended up throwing them into a baggie. The flavor was pretty decent, but using them is really not all that different from using any other ground coffee."
"Ordered this based on the good reviews ignoring the bad one. Should have ""listened"" to the bad one. Not to good in my opinion, had a stale taste to me even though date was 2012. gave a 2 star only for the conveinence of the packaging. Order at your own risk, I thought it was bad tasting coffee."
I received some reusable k-cups with this item that I am still using.  I think I would Have thrown away by Keurig brewer It not for this purchase.
I bought these to try because they were so cheap and seemed like a good idea to reuse the poems cup. The coffee rates good and it works great though admittedly more work then a one use K cup. That is mainly personal thing since it is for an up stairs second coffee put that is not near a sink so I can't simply wash it out. Otherwise they are pretty handy....though I do wonder if I am being eco after all being that I am still making trash.
"I bought one canister of each blend of EkoJava, as I love fresh ground coffee. Each one I tried was disgustingly stale, like ground coffee that had been sitting in an unsealed container for months at a time. Good concept, but a BIG disappointment!"
"Nice packaging and easy to use.  Unfortunately, if you are a serious coffee drinker and like a dark roast you will be disappointed.  The coffee does not taste freshly ground and tastes like is is old and has lost all of its flavor.  No matter what the price, bad coffee is no bargain.  Oh well...will have to stick to the more expensie Black Diamond K-cups."
"I use these packets to make my own pods for the Bunn Home Cafe. I insert a 4-cup paper filter into the pod well, pour in one of the packets, fold the filter closed, and moments later I have a great tasting mug of coffee.Coffee taste is a matter of personal preference. For my taste, the EkoJava French Roast is perfect."
"The coffee is good. On par with most other French Roast pre-ground coffees.  Smooth flavor, and the aroma is mouthwatering.  The coffee itself is 4.5 stars out of 5.These are marketed along with the EkoBrew K-Cup replacement, which is how I have been using them. The thing is - these ""single serve packets"" don't fit into the Ekobrew K-cup - there is too much coffee. There is no practical way to ""save"" the remaining grounds for use another time/day. I don't drink the same flavor every day, so it would be a few days before I rotate back to this flavor, and then I'd have to open another package to even out the amount - leaving me with another partial package. Unpractical to say the least. I bought this to save time and flavor (after exposure to air, the flavor becomes less potent.) and I'm not really saving either. I spend more time trying to tap out the proper amount of grinds to fit into the EcoBrew, and then the package is open, so the leftovers aren't as rich as the first brew.  Package review would be 2 stars out of 5 - the functionality of it is there, but the sizing needs a major improvement to be practical for what it's marketed as.In summary: Taste is great, Package size leaves a lot to be desired. 3.5/5 (rounded to 4)"
"I bought this on a Friday sale for $6.  It wasn't worth it. This coffee tastes, well, awful.  I do not like the flavor at all. I'll stick to my Deidrich or Barista Prima french roast k-cups."
Ghost is a good name. Both specimens that I purchased from this nursery gave up the ghost within a couple of weeks.
This plant came fast and was relatively tall (2-1/2 feet) with some red flowers on it already.  I found a good space and planted it immediately and it has already re-bloomed.  It is a joy to have!
I have tried several Bakery On Main Gluten Free Granola cereals and this is my favorite (and my daughter's).  The other flavors are very good (4 stars) and this one is excellent (5 stars).  I'll be reordering this one soon!  It's too bad they don't sell a variety pack (one of each flavor) so you can find your favorite and then buy a larger package.
"I was not sure about this as I'm not a big granola eater, but I'm so glad I gave it a try. It's such a great snack. It's got great crunch satisfaction.  Wish it was in bigger clusters though. At the bottom of the bag the crumbs gets too small to grab and shove in your mouth. That's when you put it on ice cream. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed."
"Great snack.  Good alone, with ice cream or anytime you just want a crunch."
"Our family has tried several of Bakery on Main's granolas - and this flavor is one of our favorites.  We don't all need to eat GF foods, but if we find something that tastes good, my family will go along with my GF lifestyle and enjoy it, too.  This is one of those foods that we all eat because it tastes great, stays crunchy with milk on it, and is good for you.  I love having the flaxseed in the granolas since it shows Bakery on Main's desire to add the ""healthier"" ingredients to their products.  Give it a try and I'm sure you'll love it, too!"
"This product is plainer then the other gronolas but I like to put it on yogurt or with fresh fruit such as bananas. Also, great to put in muffins that I make myself."
This granola is so yummy!  My daughter is gluten sensitive and we got several of the samples from Bakery on Main at a Gluten free expo.  One thing she misses the most is crunchy granola.  This satisfied her craving!  So good!
"This is certainly not your grandmother's granola. It is sweet, but not too sweet and has a huge bright coconut flavor. It tastes like it's a huge indulgence, but it's not. It's healthy for you. It's a regular snack for me."
"Be VERY careful when eating this cereal. There are tiny dried fruit pieces in the cereal which are so incredibly hard, their consistency is something akin to an uncooked grain of rice. This morning I was eating a bowl, and one of the fruit pieces became lodged between a tooth and my gums while chewing. I unfortunately now have an open, bleeding wound in my mouth thanks to this cereal. So please, be very, very careful while eating this. I never thought I would actually ever have to say that about A BREAKFAST CEREAL!"
This is my favorite brand of Gluten Free Granola! This is now my favoriteFlavor. I have 18 auto-immune diseases and 4 of them have their own specialDiets. This flavor is the closest I could get- in this flavor there are only 2-3 thingsI have to remove. I wish they would make one like Rainforest w/ no nutsand no banana chunks - then it will be perfect. I highly recomend Bakeryon Main granola!!!!
This is my favorite of the Bakery On Main mixes.  The only downside is that like the others it is fairly high calorie and will fill you up before you know it.  I usually can't stop eating it!!
"Lots of crunch and many good grains and tasty too!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000NMHHD8"">Bakery On Main, Gluten Free Granola, Rainforest, 12-Ounces (Pack of 6)</a>"
I love the Bakery on Main Granola and this is my favorite flavor minus the banana bits. I like it enough to pick out the bits of banana...but lucky for me thay are easy to see because they look like black pebbles.
"I have never been a huge granola fan until a friend sent me a bag of this granola.  Now I am hooked.  I keep a bag in my car and at home.  It makes a great snack, but it is very addicting.  I buy in bulk and still manage to run out.  My son can't leave it alone either and he didn't even realize it was gluten free."
This granola has a good taste but also has chunks that taste like banana but may be nuts.  They are so hard they make the granola unpleasant for me to eat. I won't buy this product again because of that but do enjoy other Bakery on Main products.
This spice is wonderful.  I put it in/on almost everything.  I especially like it in my omelets and on pan fried potatoes.
"I use this when cooking shrimp, shredded chicken tacos, beef, you name it...it has an AMAZING flavor and goes a long way.  I usually buy in store, but seeing it online is tempting.  Absolutely wonderful stuff.  Guests and my girlfriend rave over anything I make with this seasoning."
This product is very good. I haven't tried it in the foods that I eat but I do enjoy it in smoothies and with cereal.
Great taste and easy to use! This milled flax can really be used in anything to add a little extra goodness to a meal. I like to sprinkle this on just about everything. Great price.
"I have been using this product now for over a year.  I put one scoop in my oatmeal, it adds the benefit of Omega 3s and enhances the taste.  I also use it on salads, in breads, on yogurt ect.  I keep the container in the refrigerator.  I like this hard plastic storage container better than flax seed in a foil package as it is easier to store.  Comes with the plastic scoop.  Great product overall."
I've tried many different types of milled flax and this is the best.  I add it to my oatmeal and it doesn't add a gritty texture like some other flax powders do.  I definitely recommend it.
Have been usuing these for a few years. This product was very fresh and packeged nicely.
"these crackers were excellent. very fresh,tasty.  they arrived quickly and were sealed well. they were eaten so quicklywe wanted more.  would recommend them for special occasions."
Good timing & very organized. This order got to me in due time & no issues occurred. I will definitely buy from this user again.
"Love this item.  It arrived in a timely manner and was well packed.  Also, just as described.  Would definately purchase again from this vendor."
"This is the first time I have ever had Edamame...and I LOVE it! I find the quality of Roland foods to be excellent, and these are exceptionally delicious and great for someone that is trying to watch their fat intake, AND have a crunchy snack.I am not one that loves salt and find these to be perfect for my tastes, if you're a ""salt"" person, you may find you need more salt -- but they are perfect for me!"
"These are a wonderful, healthy snack to carry along anywhere. They're not a boring food, though they're simple. They have the skins and a little salt--just right!"
These are a great snack.  They are filling and healthy for you.  My 3 year old even loves them.
"I've had some trouble trying to find easy, on the go vegetables to make my healthier eating habits possible. (also good for vegetarians who need protein, since they are a bean) I've had fresh or frozen edamame and enjoyed them so I thought I'd try these. They are very tasty; they have a good, subtle flavor, a little nutty. They are slightly dry, but no more than say an average cracker or something like that. I will definitely add them to my lunch rotation :) I also like that the food is not very processed, with only three ingredients (soybeans, maltodrextrin, sea salt). I love that I found them on Amazon, since they don't have them in my regular grocery story so the convenience is a major plus!"
These are a great snack. They are filling and healthy for you. All soynuts are rather dry but these aren't so dry that they absorb all the saliva in your mouth as some do. Excellent glycemic index
"I thought they were Japanese edamame, but they were from China and I do not eat food products from China, so I gave them away"
"They don't look anything like what is on the cover!  They are dry andtaste like saw dust.  They fall apart in your mouth like dried out leavesor grass.  Horrible taste or for that matter, there is none!  I'm throwingmine away.  Ugh!!  Horrible."
I looked everywhere for an ingredient label before I purchase these and could find nothing.  They have maltodextrin in them unlike the Seapoint Farms brand.  I will continue to by Seapoint instead of this brand.
This product is so watery. I cannnot believe they are calling this 100% juice.  What a shame!  I am cancelling this order.What surprises me is that Amazon carries such product without testing?I tried a different brand (genesis) and it is some much better but it was expensive which is why I tried this one.I even sent an email to the company Dynamics with no response.
"As I continued to take my acai shots in the morning and evening, I noticed a new but familiar desire in myself. I finally wanted to exercise again!! To my delight after my second full 32.0z bottle of acai gold. I am up in the mornings walking on my treadmill. Mind you this has not happened in almost 15yrs!! I was a regular exercise junkie back then but over the years poor eating habits and lack of exercise has left me listless and depressed. A friend recommended I try acai berry for weight loss but it has been soo much more than that!! I tried the organic vs. conventional because I wanted to get as close to natural as I could.I found this product to be a bit watery and murky looking, but from what I read the apperance is the way it is suppose to be. The seeds are apparent when you drink it and the taste is a cross between berry and chocolate. Overall not bad and I feel it does work over a period of time, might I add like anything worth having, you have to wait for it!!!"
"I have been drinking Acai Gold for about two months and here is what I have noticed. My energy level went up a great deal in the beginning. Followed by a lack of appetite. Then I began to notice that I was losing weight since I wasn't eating as much.After two months, my hair is really healthy and shiny. Since I gave birth to my second child, my hair and skin have not looked this vibrant in some time. I was warned that acai juice doesn't taste very good but I actually like the taste of this juice. Just make sure to shake it before you pour so the seeds are not all settled at the bottom.I like ordering it by the case since my husband has now joined me in my ritual of taking acai shots. Dynamic Health was professional and prompt in fulfilling my order. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the results that I hoped to achieve by consuming acai."
"normally this is a very good product, 5 star... however, this time, it tasted a bit spoiled or sour....  No worries though, I was quickly reimbursed for the product and all is well."
This is 100% mangosteen juice and it works great!  I have fibromyalgia and the mangosteen juice has helped reduce the inflamation in my muscles. Even my massage therapist has noticed a difference.
"I HAVE BEEN ON AUTO DELIVERY FOR MANY MONTHS NOW...I BUY GOJI, ACAI, AND MANGOSTEEN JUICE.  IT POUR ALL 3 BOTTLES INTO ONE LARGE CONTAINER FOR EASY STORAGE AND MORNING TAKING....SHAKE IT GOOD AND POUR ABOUT 3 SHOT GLASS AMOUNTS INTO MY GLASS.  COMBINING THE 3 JUICES HELPS COMBAT THE BAD TASTE OF ACAI...CAUSE THE OTHER 2 ARE SWEETER.  THESE PRODUCTS JUST GIVE ME THE ""I FEEL GOOD"" ENERGY TO GO ABOUT MY DAY. I LOVE KNOWING THAT I AM GETTING EACH OF THEIR HEALTH BENEFITS AND LOTS OF ANTIOXIDANTS TOO.  I SWEAR THERE ARE UNEXPLAINABLE HEALTH IMPROVEMENTS FOR ME THAT SEEM TO COME AS A SIDE EFFECT.  FEELING GREAT AT 58 !!!"
I purchase this product on a regular basis. I have a fragile immune system and this seems to help keep me well. My doctor has also recommended this to many of her other patients.
"Aug 2012 - I used Dynamic Health's Acai Gold as a last resort, because nothing else seemed to touch the extra weight I'd been carrying for years. Lo and behold! My appetite not only decreased, I seemed to have less craving for sugar. And I felt more energetic. Not miraculously so, but I have chronic fatigue, so any increase in energy is worth noting. I lost 12 lbs in under 2 weeks. Someone said I was probably just losing water weight. I replied that I didn't care how I lost the weight; I hadn't been able to lose any weight for several years, and was just happy to weigh less. I maintained the weight loss for several months, but didn't lose any more, so I decided to stop taking Acai Gold.  Over the next few months, I regained 10 lbs., so I'm placing another order, today. Good stuff!Sep 2012 - I've been taking 1-2 ozs of Acai Gold again for the past few weeks, and have lost 7 lbs.! And that's in spite of my forgetting to take it for almost a week after someone pushed it to the back of the fridge, so I didn't get the visual reminder to take it every day. Again I notice that my appetite and cravings for sugar have decreased. Again I feel a little more alert and energetic and have less muscle pain and spasms than I typically have from fibromyalgia. Definitely good stuff!"
Acai in my book is over rated. We no longer drink them and we still feel the same and saving money.
"This product is advertised as a 12 pack of juice. You absolutely do not get 12 bottles. You get 1 bottle. So you do not save the hundreds that they advertise you to be saving. Lies, Lies, Lies."
"After a week now of drinking the 2 oz in the morning and chasing it with orange juice, I think I've identified what that awful taste is like! It's like drinking Kalamata olive juice. I love kalamata olives but not to drink its juice straight!"
"If anything I have notice a slight benefit in memory (short term, but I still forget peoples names when we meet. LOLTaste is OK can't quite explain it. I mix 1 oz in a glass of water and drink it first thing in the morning."
"This is probably some of the purest form of acai out on the  market.  It is organic and completely pure.  The delivery was prompt and the seller was professional.  The only reason I don't give it a five-star rating is that for some reason acai juice in general seems to make me go into depression.  I have a very sensitive system so it probably won't be a common side-effect for most people,  but I do want others to know that it is a possibility.  Acai is full of nutrition and benefits, but I had to stop drinking it because it caused depression in me."
MY BABIES' MAMA AND I HAVE BEEN ENJOYING ACAI GOLD FOR A FEW MONTHS.  I RUN AND EXERCISE FIVE TO SIX TIMES A WEEK.  I DEFINITELY FEEL THE GREAT BENEFITS OF ACAI GOLD.  FEELING MORE ENERGETIC AND ALERT ARE TWO GREAT EXAMPLES.  I AM ALSO CONVINCED THAT IT IS HELPING ME WITH MY DIGESTIVE SYSTEM.  THANK YOU DYNAMIC HEALTH!!
"I'm not disputing that it may be good for us, but YUCK! My husband and I are trying valiantly to get through a bottle of this ""juice"", but it isn't anything like the acai berry juice we've purchased elsewhere. The other tasted like boysenberry; this tastes ""just not good"". Which is why it's probably better for us. But there's no sense in our buying it if we're not going to drink it, so this is our first and last bottle."
"My local grocery stopped carrying it.  I must have this to make my homemade pork chop suey!  My mom used it, and so do I, as does my daughter."
"I suppose this sauce is harder to find because few people use it...but, if they only knew!  You can drizzle this over a roast and get the best flavor for your au jus.  You can use a bit to make your own gravy.  Add it to barbecue sauce to tone down the sweetness, or, it also helps to sear steak tips.  I've tried multiple other products and Dynasty's Brown Gravy Sauce is the best!"
"Easy to use.  At first I used too much because I didn't realize it would make so much gravy for so little of the product.  After that it was just great.  Even when I have juices to make gravy, I add some of the sauce to spruce it up."
"I have an 8 year old and a 2 year old. They are both very finicky and get bored with food easily. If they don't like a food, they just lick up the gravy and the rest dries out, so the leftovers go outside for the feral cats. I'm always on the search for new things to let them try. Now that one of my cats is getting older, I'm getting proactive about his urinary tract health so I was happy to find the variety of Friskies Senior cannned cat food here on Amazon. This flavor is their favorite, they lick their plate clean. It has chunks that are small enough for my older cat to eat (he has some missing teeth, I took him in as a stray) and plenty of gravy which both of them love. I like that when I open the can it smells like real meat instead of stinky mystery meat by products. This food ( any flavor) is a great deal on this site. Friskies runs about 50 cents a can when it's on sale at the grocery store, and with Super Saver Shipping I come out almost equal and don't have to wait for sales to stock up. There are also so many flavors available here that aren't in stores. My furry friends are happy, so I'm happy."
"Amazon had a wonderful sale with super saver shipping,so I decided to try it out on my aging cat community outside. All of them ate it and I was even able to hide their medications in it. I noticed it smelled good and seemed fresh. For that I give a big thumbs up to Friskies :)"
My cats actually at the bits instead of just licking the gravy as they usually do. and they ate it all at once instead of leaving a bit for later....will be buying again!
"I have five cats: two inside kitties and three feral cats (yes, they are spayed/neutered)that live in dogloos in my garden. All five love Friskies Senior Diet Lamb and Rice, and I know it's good for them. Amazon is competitvely priced even when compared to sales with coupons."
"My four cats really, really like Friskies Cat Food Meaty Bits Senior Diet with Lamb & Rice in Gravy.  I add a little warm water which makes even more gravy and then mix in a small amount of dry food.  My cats are very impatient that I'm not faster at feeding them.  It doesn't matter to them that there is a pop tab on the can so I open it quickly.  In their opinion, I simply don't put the plates down fast enough.  I think they were watching episodes of Star Trek: The Next Generation where Data gives a command to the unit in his quarters and a mere second or two later, a bowl of food appears for his cat Spot.  I appreciate that Friskies Lamb & Rice comes in a senior formula as three of my cats are seniors and this formula is easy for them to digest."
"Although this isn't his absolute favorite, I always have a few cans on hand to toss into the mix whenever my male gets tired of his regular routine. If you've EVER had a Persian (and PLEASE, feel sorry for me because I have TWO), you KNOW they're the most finicky of all cats.  But, every male I've ever had has gone crazy over this lamb variety.  It's just something very different, something they just don't make in every brand, so it's quite nice to have the change.  It has bits of rice in it which, although my guy thinks it's VERY unmanly, he does eat it clean.  I do recommend this variety, even though it's diet, he's had it since he was a year old.  Great stuff, highly recommend!"
"I bought this cat food because of the wonderful low price and I enjoy the adorable cat on the commercials. My cats did eat this food, in fact they really enjoyed it. However, after reading the ingredients and doing some research, I completely regret purchasing it and feel just awful for feeding it to my cats. The first few ingredients are (which indicates the most prevalent ingredients) are water sufficient for processing, meat by-products, chicken, turkey, and wheat gluten. At least there is chicken and turkey in it, which is the only reason it got more than 1 star from me. But other than that its all nasty stuff. Wheat Gluten is just gross and by-products aren't even a real meat! By-products are the stuff leftover once all the actual meat is harvested. We're talking beaks, chicken feet, eyeballs, even chicken poop! I would not recommend this product. It is just not a good quality cat food. I think the only reason why it was cat-approved may be because it contains artificial flavors that taste good to cats and because I usually feed them dry food for dental reasons and wet food puts off much more of a scent for them to enjoy. I recommend to stay far away from Friskies, as it is simply a very low quality filler food. Other Friskies flavors are even worse than this one. Even though the price is quite inexpensive, your cat will actually eat more than if you paid for a better quality food, because they will never feel full. Cats need to eat real, identifiable, pure meat, and there just isn't enough real meat in this food. When purchasing a cat (or dog) food, the most important thing to consider is the first 3 ingredients; just make sure those first three are decent ingredients that you can identify and would eat yourself. Now that I know what to look for, I usually buy my pets all natural foods such as Natural Balance, Blue Buffalo, Halo, or Wellness. All of those brands contain real, whole meats that I myself would eat, with no added fillers or low quality foods."
"Contrary to what the picture on the labels implies, there aren't any meowing, cuddly kitten inside these cans! There's only mediocre fois gras in them. Two stars because my husband loves this fois gras on toast corners."
"When blended teas became available a few years ago I jumped to try as many as I could. The fun wore off when most of the blends I tried were too unbalanced or too simple for the ingredients to really get synergy. I then went for blends only as medicinal support.This Cucumber White blend really scared me (vegetables and white tea??) but I tried it on the insistence of a friend. I was floored by how round and full of flavor this blend is. This tea manages to come across as calmly invigorating and robustly refreshing. The cucumber is a subtle, fresh note atop the more earthy white tea base. I can taste the tiniest hint of lime, too.All-in-all it's a playful, grown-up blend that gives just enough caffeine to perk me up. It's low enough in caffeine that I can drink it a couple hours after my morning coffee and it doesn't make me feel caffeinated at all.I think this would be a great iced tea, too. If I had a spa/salon/wellness center I would serve this tea!Even if the idea of Cucumber White tea puts you off, try it. I think you'll be as surprised as I was."
"A wonderful tea, one of the better ones Tazo had offered.  Light flavor, not too much caffeine.  I wish it was available everywhere - please make it a standard offering so I can continue buying it by the box. I'd even sign up for auto-ship!"
The following recommendation is based on having enjoyed over 100 tea varieties in the last 2+ years.Tazo Cucumber White has a pleasant and mild when prepared as recommended.Very Nice.
"This pasta sauce has organic ingredients, no added sodium and tastes great.  Also, its glass jar packaging avoids potentially dangerous chemical leaching that can occur with canned tomato sauce.  Finding a reasonably priced, organic, no sodium tomato sauce in a jar is difficult.  I eat it daily because research has shown that the anti-oxidant lycopene in tomatoes (particularly cooked tomatoes as in sauce) is extremely beneficial for prostate health, especially when eaten with olive oil.  For these reasons, I recommend this product."
"My search is over. Previously, I had passed this item over, because I thought it had oil in it, and I was looking for a no fat added item. Mrs. Esselstyn, via DVD, gave a correct description of this sauce, I ordered 10 jars, and I was delighted with the taste. I hope the sellers will have a subscription service in the future, so I don't have to manually reorder. Great product."
Lower sodium tomato sauce has all the benefits of a spaghetti sauce without the issue of high sodium content. I've used 6 bottles and I'm pleased (I do add a bit of hot sauce but I do to everything). I believe it's a good buy and heart healthy.
"What a terrible dinner.  I just wasted 2 pounds of ground chuck from the butcher shop and a box of organic quinoa pasta.  If you would like to experience the taste of this sauce, there's no need to buy it.  Just take the bottle of lemon juice from the refrigerator and drink straight from the bottle!!  I make my own homemade sauce from fresh tomatoes often.  This sauce doesn't taste like there is even tomatoes in it.  As far as I'm concerned between the beef, pasta and fresh sauted veggies I put into it, it ended up wasting me around $20 and forced my family to quick scrounge for a fast dinner.  It hardly tasted like food!!"
We tried this sauce because it said no sodium added. When I tasted it I felt like I was drinking lemon juice. It was very sour and super watery. I will not buy it again. Going back to regular stuff and not taking chances with organic items anymore.
"These Nonni's Biscotti ""Turtle Pecan"" are good tasting, somewhat sweet and have 110 calories each. My wife found these at local specialty store and they have quickly become a favorite with my wife and teen son when we sit down for coffee or tea, but, being a purist, I prefer the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7YO2M"">Nonni's Biscotti, Originali, 8-Count Boxes (Pack of 12)</a>. The flavors are balanced but there are occasional chewy blobs encountered.I do like that the individual wrapped ""cookies"" keeps them fresh even after the box is opened.Recommended!CFH"
"Japanese green tea has a cleaner, grassier flavor than the Chinese variety.  You don't get as much tea for the money with this one as the less expensive brands, and I find the flavor to be too subtle.  But after reading about the potential dangers of fluoride in green teas, especially the non-organic and Chinese varieties, I will try to stay with this kind, which is said to have a lower level of the carcinogen.  The Tazo China Green Tips green tea has a stronger flavor I prefer, but is said to have a high(er) level of fluoride.  I figure going organic AND Japanese Sencha will reduce my exposure to a degree.  The plastic cover on each teabag is hard to tear without also ripping the delicate bag inside.  Perhaps they should look at the way other brands encase their bags.  The company could reduce the amount of packaging as well by reducing the size of the outer box, which is bigger than it really needs to be.Addendum: After a couple of months of trying this tea, I've knocked off two stars.  I find this one just lacks flavor, and I've wasted about a half-dozen bags that tore open while I tried to open the wrapper, no matter how careful I was.  You should be able to tear open the wrappers, but even if I cut them open, some bags were adhered to the inside of their wrapper and tore open when pulled out. The wrappers are tough plastic and the bags are very delicate. And the strings come off easily, especially while steeping in hot water.  We won't be buying it again."
"I don't claim to be a tea connoisseur but I really do like this tea.  It is has a smooth taste.  I prefer to make iced green tea than hot.  I have only tried two other brands, one being Lipton, and I like this one the best so far. It is also a pretty good deal for the quality you get.  You can really see the hearty dark green tea leaf in the bag after brewing this tea. Recommended."
"I copy and paste from skacleve's review, because I have had almost the same experience.  I lived in Japan for 3 years and know how sencha should taste.  Like skacleve, ""I find this one just lacks flavor"".  I've been through almost four 18-count boxes, and like skacleve, ""I've wasted [over a dozen] bags that tore open while I tried to open the wrapper, no matter how careful I was. You should be able to tear open the wrappers, but even if I cut them open, some bags were adhered to the inside of their wrapper and tore open when pulled out. The wrappers are tough plastic and the bags are very delicate. And the strings come off easily, especially while steeping in hot water."""
"This House Blend is a decent breakfast blend and leans more to the medium side than the bold side of coffee.  However, there is a slight kick to it, so solid medium coffee drinkers may not like the blend.This k-cup has a balanced flavor and is not bitter.  However, the coffee flavor it isn't memorable either.  I would put it in the flavor category with <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004M63EI8"">Tully's House Blend, K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Coffee People, Donut Shop K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> - a good breakfast coffee, but not good enough to pay extra to drink.Disclosure: I received this kcup in a free sample pack mailed by Keurig to its customers."
"I delayed purchasing it (I have a $.50/cup limit and Barista runs twice that) until I found it on sale.  Having used Keurig pots since they first came out a decade ago (?) and having tried about 80 flavors, I'm going to put this coffee right up in the top 10.  I prefer it's Italian brother slightly but find this coffee to be both bold enough for my tastes and smooth enough for my partner's taste.  We have a house full of guests now and the carousel has dozens of different coffees on it but the Barista is the one I keep having to refill.But it's not good enough to cost $1 a cup.8/12 - found them for $.60 a k-cup (box of 96)."
"This is Donna's husband speaking. This is great coffee. Very bold but not bitter, great flavor. My favorite of all the K-cups that I've tried."
"These Barista Prima ""House Blend"" K-Cups produce an excellent cup of coffee! We found these on clearance at a department store and decided to give them a try. We normally use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0029XDZIK"">Donut Shop K-Cup packs for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 50)</a> (we have them on ""subscribe and save""), but this ""House Blend"" coffee is generally superior tasting and provides a nice caffeine lift in the morning.The premium price will keep this from becoming my regular daily coffee, but it is good enough to keep on hand for guests or when I want to spoil myself a little.Highly Recommended!CFH"
I bought these vanilla beans in 2007 and five years later they still made a delicious vanilla syrup. I've used them in other recipes although I found them difficult to open since they seem to dry out a bit. When I make vanilla syrup all I do is cut the beans into half inch pieces. To make a syrup bring two cups water and two cups granulated sugar to a boil. Add in eight cut up vanilla beans. When boiling lower heat so that the syrup is still rolling but more like a simmer. Simmer for 15 minutes. You want a bit of the water to evaporate. Then turn off the heat and cover the syrup. Leave it overnight so more vanilla is infused into the syrup. Then strain it through cheesecloth and pour it into a prepared bottle. I use an old vanilla syrup bottle. When you make your own syrup you don't have to worry about preservatives and it tastes way better. You can then drizzle your homemade syrup over fresh fruit or put it in your coffee. Don't expect the syrup to be clear however. The vanilla beans do color the syrup a bit.~The Rebecca Review
"This is a lot of Vanilla Beans for the price. There are better and worse beans out there but this is a good solid choice. Using real vanilla adds real flavor. I enjoy liquid vanilla, vanilla flakes and all the others but vanilla beans is on another level. Great to add to home made ice cream! I like to chew on a bean while I am cooking with them"
"This item is PERFECT for making many things, not to mention reasonably priced.  I love making my own vanilla and kahlua to give as presents...and, of course, to use myself:)  These beans appear fresh and ideal for what I need.  Can't do without them!"
"I'm a mustard fan, Heinz (The kind that could be found in restaurants in glass bottles called ""pourable"" and now Annie's.) The yellow mustard is heavy, thick  and richly flavored. The vinegar used is bright and snappy.  My only hesitation is their plastic container. It doesn't drain well and even when left to stand upside down for days won't flow to the mouth of the container.  It's badly designed for the thickness of their product and thus, maybe a quarter of its contents is unusable.I'm conducting an experiment currently . By measuring the weight of a full container, the weight of  the container when it won't give any more product and the weight of the container rinsed clean, I should be able to calculate exactly how much is lost due to the bottle not being designed appropriately. I'll report back when completed. Probably seems to most to be a ridiculous activity but at my age we take pleasure where we can find it. I'll report back when completed.Anyway for those that like mustard  this is a solid tasty mustard, maybe the best I've had of the Yellow mustard type.  If you like a hearty bright mustard try it."
My daughter loves this flavor and all I've tried on her so far. She brings us a pouch when she's hungry.
"My toddler loved the flavor of these. I like the price and the fact that Amazon delivered them to my door. HOWEVER, we ordered several Plum Tots with Quinoa flavors. For some reason, my daughter seemed to have digestive issues (runny stools and vomiting) with them. Not sure if it was the product or her system but I can tell you that she eats fresh bananas, home cooked rice and Quinoa without a problem. We threw the rest of the Plum Tots products in the trash once we figured out what was happening. Haven't purchased a Plum Tots product since."
"*****This chai tea contains fair trade certified and organic assam black tea, organic cinnamon, organic anise, and organic cardamom. I enjoy a strong chai and all of these spices, so I typically leave the tea bag in my tea, not ever removing it. Numi tea does not get bitter when you do this. It might take me a half hour to drink the tea, but it still tastes wonderful and very strong, so this works for me.All of Numi's teas are the absolute best quality, using premium organic teas and herbs and real fruits, flowers, and spices (as opposed to ""natural"" flavors or fragrances). They are also gluten-free. Numi uses natural biodegradable filter-paper tea bags, not GMO corn or plastic silky bags. Their boxes are recyclable and are printed with soy-based inks. From beginning to end, this is a tea that exceeds all of my expectations.Highly recommended.*****"
"I love Numi's Golden Chai, so I ordered their Holiday Chai to try for the holidays and to add to Christmas gift bags. The first cup I brewed, I steeped the bag as I usually would and it was a little light for my taste. So the next cup I let it steep about a minute longer and it was great. Overall I would still say the spices might be a little lighter than the Golden Chai.  But it's still a very tasty tea.  You can't go wrong with Numi tea. Love that they are all organic and fair trade."
"I usually make my own chai with all the spices, but I wanted to have a simple tea bag for when I don't have time to make a real pot of chai. This is by far the best chai tea bag I have tried. It has really great flavor."
"This tea with a little bit a milk is now one of my favorite things.  Perfect blend of ingredients.  So yummy.  I've tried other brands of tea, but Numi is the best.  Such a pure, clean taste and it doesn't get that weird foam at the top of my cup like other brands.  And I love how each bag is in it's own little package.  The holiday chai is perfect for everyday-not just holidays."
"I love this variety of chai!  I have 1-2 daily with added splenda, vanilla, and milk or cream.  Delicious!  Strong enough and not too bitter!"
I purchased these gummies really skeptical because I dont particularly like gummies or sweets. I was pleasantly suprised; These gummies are absolutely divine!!! The Great taste + perfect texture combined makes for a delicious sweet snack (not to mention the sour part) My whole family loved them and I will definitely buy them again soon. Also the price was great for the large quantity received. Thanks so much...
Excellent quality and value product. Peppers are whole and they freeze well if you won't be using them all at once.
Buy 4 and get free shipping. These are the best fire roasted peppers. My husband uses them in everything. We used to buy by the jar and this is a better deal.
"In spite of the bad packaging, which bent the cans on all sides, surprisingly the peppers were okay. I just cleaned them under running water, then added condiments, oil and vinegar. They taste delicious."
"I saw Peppy Kernels on Bob's Red Mill's web site. I'm always looking for healthier ways eat and this product looked interesting. Peppy Kernels has a unique nutty taste, texture and excellent mouth feel. I add a serving to oatmeal along with hemp seeds for a solid way to start the day. This is a must for the cupboard, especially if you like oatmeal. If you like it really crunchy, add some to yogurt."
"A fine, clean tea without the murk or acrid aftertaste (maybe confused with kick or aroma?)not usual to brands of English Breakfast. Try it."
I agree with the previous reviewer--missing the aroma. I'm still buying though. Can't beat the price.
well... it won't kill you. the flavor is good. the aroma is so so. price is the best reason to buy this.
See's candy is always good!  The candy we recieved through Amazon was good but not fresh.  Most pieces were starting to change to a chalk color and were dry. We were disappointed in the quality of our shipment.
"To our taste these chocolates are on a par with far more expensive ones in glittery gift boxes.<p>  We often take them as hostess gifts (hoping, of course, that said hostess will immediately open them and pass them around.)<p>  See's Candies hasn't disappointed us yet."
Chocolates are great. Shipping costs are high. They took close to a week to actually ship the chocolates.
"See's Candies is a well-known San Francisco chocolate company, now with stores throughout the United States.  In California, the lines to buy chocolate can snake out the door.  I've had See's Candies many times, most recently this assortment, and while See's makes an excellent product, the chocolate coating could be richer in flavor.  Still, these confections are above average; they easily outclass ordinary brands such as Russell Stover and Whitman's with fresher and more flavorful fillings.<p>Anyone receiving a box of See's Candies for a gift knows that an extra effort has been made.  Although they aren't the best I've had, they certainly rank up there with the finest chocolate assortments available in a box."
The problem is not with the candy. Amazon pictures a christmas box but instead you get the regular white box.
"$13.95 in shipping (5-7 days) for a $26.00 order!?!?!?  Do the math, that's OVER 50% extra on shipping alone.  Are you crazy?  We're not talking about Scharffen Berger chocolates here and they only charge $9 for 3 to 5 days (for a $30 order).  I don't care what chocolate you buy, but don't get taken on the shipping for a cheap product!!!"
I really enjoy sending things online. This purchase was a gift so I really think that there should have been available a gift card to send with it. I had to mail a card separate from this purchase.
"Although I have never ordered the candies from a website, I have heard from other reviews that the shipping is outrageous. I find that very disapointing since the chocolates themselves are so outstanding. However, these are available at other locations like airports around the country. That is, now a days you need to actually be flying in order to enter the shopping area, but that are often there if you do!"
"Nothing particulary outstanding about this chocolate, it's good but the extremely high shipping/handling costs not worth it."
they were really great and they came in excellent condition and i was a little worried with the heat that we have been having back here but it was in a cool chest and the candy did not melt and they had all the great taste of the candies that you get in the store. and the shipping was great too.
"I've tried the rest, but this is the BEST!I've been eating See's candies since I was just a kid!  Easter was one of my favorite holidays, because my mom would order See's large easter eggs, we would get to pick our favorite filling, Chocolate or Chocolate Walnut, then we'd get a medium chocolate egg, I would always choose the Bordeaux (by far the best flavored candy See's sells), you could get the divinity if you liked that.  The buttercream is always a huge favorite at our house.  You have your choice of Dark or Milk chocolate. Choose your own liking!  I prefer Milk chocolate.  Another of my favorites is California Brittle.  Also, the Vanilla Nut Carmel (no chocolate on this one), but very tasty!Just remember the Assorted premade box doesn't always have the best picks in it.  If you like nuts and chews, that's one of the better choices.  I prefer to go down to See's and select my own mix!  Pecan turtles--just melt in your mouth.  Try the truffles if you like!Never did like Godiva or Fanny Farmer, once in awhile I could take a piece of Helen Grace or Lindt, but they never live up to my standards.See's is the perfect candy and it makes the perfect gift for family, friends, co-workers, neighbors, service company's and the postal person.  Don't cross anyone off your list until you surprise them with a gift of See's candy for the Holidays."
I always send See's as a gift to relatives!  They are worth the extra shipping cost and have always arrived in perfect condition.
"The quality, presentation and taste of See's is top notch. We highly recommend the two pound box as a gift. The assortment is a nice mix and there's something for everyone's taste."
"We ordered the box of candy for an anniversary gift along with a separate order of flowers.  The flowers arrived in a timely fashion but the candy arrived 6 days later.  When they arrived they were completely melted and had reformed in the box.  The recipient called to say what had happened.  A replacement box was sent a week later.  We don't know who to blame for the delay in shipping or for the manner in which it was shipped.  If you would like to discuss this matter further, please call me at 888.671.6402.Sincerely,Janet Mack Zaloga"
The only all natural dog food my dog will eat.  I mix a little of their canned dog food in it and he chows it down and he's a very picky Havanese.
"Let ME preface MY review by saying that I actually HAVE tried it and it is well worth the price! The grind is perfect for my Solofill and tastes better than any K-cup I've ever used. But here's something I do not get at all! Did that reviewer really just say ""It's a lot cheaper to continue using my Solofill cup to scoop some coffee out of the can""?  I don't get it... the logic I mean. I buy a 2 liter bottle of soda when there's a birthday party or office party, picnic, etc. I KNOW that the bottle will be gone and it's cheaper by the ounce. But that doesn't keep me from buying a 12 oz. can of the same brand of soda!!! Ounce for ounce a can of soda costs FIVE times as much as a 2 liter bottle.  But it doesn't take a coffee snob to figure out after a few days that the ground coffee in that can is losing its flavor the same way a bottle of coke loses its fizz after a few days. If you don't want to spend money on Ekojava coffee packets, then at least buy whole bean coffee and grind it as you use it.But then I suppose someone would say ""Why not just buy K-cups then?"". Good question - easy answer (in my world anyway).These little sticks of coffee that are ground nicely, weighed out perfectly (instead of the freaking mess you make scooping coffee out of a can or bag), and FRESH! So far, sounds like a K-cup. BUT... I use other things to brew coffee other than a Keurig. The packets work in the Melitta I have in my office. I gave a handful of sticks to my neighbor who tried it in his drip coffeemaker. After trying it a few times, he found that one packet in a drip coffeemaker using a paper filter makes 5 cups of awesome drip coffee! Try that with a K-cup! AND JUST out of curiosity, I stopped by a very cool coffee shop in Boise, Idaho (Salt Tears... VERY cool place!) They have a pour over bar and use the Coava Kone filters instead of paper. I asked him if I could use my coffee packet instead of there DOMA coffee (one of a few roasters in Idaho I would recommend). The water was at 206 degrees and he expertly poured about a third of the water in. The coffee began to de-gas (yeah... ain't gonna happen with ground coffee from a can) and then finished off the pour and we waited. We were both pretty blown away. It was awesome.Bottom line? Not sure I'd recommend this to people who are happy with coffee from a can. And I am NOT knocking those who do. My father scooped Folgers from a can when I was a kid and for years I thought that was the epitome of great coffee (but then, I also used to think hamburger was the highest quality beef). But I confess... that sounds a bit condescending and I realize that many people truly enjoy simple store brand ground coffee in their Keurig. My point it, just because you own a Keurig and a Solofill, doesn't qualify you to write a review for something you've never even tried. Dude... At least try something before you review it. C'mon... really? Okay, I sound like a snob. But I guess that's my point. If you are happy with ground coffee from a can, this probably doesn't make sense. If you are more discriminating than that, and you need something to take with you that is a high quality, one cup solution, is fresh, and you want to use it anywhere in almost anything, then heck yeah... this is a great buy!!!"
These individual pre-measured coffee packs work great in the Solofill and ekobrew.The Grind seems perfect and brewed a decent cup of coffee in my Keurig B70 on the 8oz cup size.Getting coffee with the perfect grind to work in the solofill & ekobrew is a challenge unless you have a good burr grinder so this is a really convenient alternative.I'm more of a dark roast extra bold Kcup drinker and this is a much lighter roast than I prefer.The Flavor I would rate as average but nothing special.reminded my of the average ground coffee you find on grocery store shelfs.Amazon had it priced really low so I gave it a try and it serves its purpoes well at that price point.
"This review is on the coffee itself, not the packaging or the EkoBrew concept itself.  If this were for the packaging and concept, it would be 5 stars.  These little suckers are convenient and work fabulously with the EkoBrew cup gizmo.  Even though I don't care for this blend of coffee, I'm glad I purchased it to get a manufacturer-provided example of the type of grind and proper amount of coffee to use in the EkoBrew cup.)This Honduras House Blend coffee is a medium-light roast coffee at best.  Weaker than anything you'd get at a restaurant or coffee shop, that's for sure.  It's not acidy or bitter at all, just not full-bodied or bold flavored.  I tend to use a heavy hand with my cream, and for this coffee only needed about half as much.  As a reference, I drink Newman's Own K-cups on a daily basis and find them to be a near-perfect cup of coffee.  I do prefer darker roasts like Green Mountain's Sumatra Reserve or Dark Magic.This isn't a *bad* roast, just a weak one.  I'm sure there are some people who would like this (maybe occasional coffee drinkers?) but no one in my house enjoyed it."
"I ordered 3 different blends to try this coffee out. So far I've just tried the Honduras House Blend, and am very pleased. I've been rather partial to Green Mountain K-cups, but this EkoJava blend has even my favorite GM blend beat in the flavor department, in my opinion. It is not as convenient as K-cups in that, regardless of the ""no mess"" claim, it will always be easier to throw out a K-cup than to clean a filter. But it certainly isn't difficult, and for the superior flavor and the reduced waste, it's certainly worth it. I highly recommend it!"
"My husband and I don't have a Keurig but since we like going on 3 day trips a lot, we like the sticks. My husband drinks more than I do so I make a full 12 cup pot using just 2 sticks. It was PERFECT!!! Not weak but not too strong. So, I can get 150 cups out of a canister. I see they are now $10. Even better! Got my calculator out and... That comes out to LESS than 7 cents a cup! I'm sold!!! We got it for taking trips but it's good enough and inexpensive enough, we are buying this for home now. No grinding, stays fresh and tastes great. I have no idea how someone could give this just one start! He  (or she?) didn't even try it!"
"My wife likes the French Roast, Honduran House Blend, West Coast Roast, Breakfast Blend, Sumatran, and then Donut Cafe in that order.  I prefer the Donut Cafe, Sumatran, French Roast, Breakfast Blend, West Coast, then Honduran.  They each have subtle differences and are a good alternative to more expensive Green Mountain (K-cups) varieties.  These tend to work better with the My K Cup (reusable filter) than Folgers or other regular coffees due to the finer grind and package size.  I paid $3.82 per 25 count container on my last order before the price went back up to $11.99 and would pay that again.  I don't think I would pay regular price however."
I have been using this coffee in the keurig at work because the price of K cups has skyrocketed. I like the price and the convenience but wish the coffee tasted a bit better
"Ever since the cost of k-cups sky-rocketed, I've been searching for a cheaper alternative to brewing a cup of good joe.  I'm very happy to have found EkoJava.  The coffee is a tad weaker than the k-cups I purchase (French Roast), but for $0.20/cup it is well worth the switch.  I am also pleased to have found a way to use my Keurig that does not produce as much waste as k-cups.Overall, I'm happy with this coffee, the ease of using it, and (most importantly) the price!"
The packaging is convenient but the coffee itself is nothing special.  I probably will not buy again unless it is just dirt cheap.
"I have tried 3 different blends of this coffee and think they are great. I use the solofill, but am thinking of buying ekobrew cup. Even with the solofill or ekobrew cup this is a good buy and your not putting all those kcups in the landfill."
"In addition to liking the whole EkoJava concept, they also have good, fresh coffee well-sealed in the single serving packets."
"I bought one canister of each blend of EkoJava, as I love fresh ground coffee. Each one I tried was disgustingly stale, like ground coffee that had been sitting in an unsealed container for months at a time. Good concept, but a BIG disappointment!"
"I am glad I only paid about $4 for this coffee...the taste is just blah! Being Central-American coffee, I was expecting something similar to Costa Rican taste. I struggled to taste that crisp coffee flavor; alas it is just bland."
"I purchased this item as a companion gift to a new coffee maker.  When I received the shipment, this container of coffee had been previously opened.  The item does not qualify for return, so I am stuck with a previously opened food item that I cannot return.  Buyer Beware."
It was not apparent to me that these were not K-cups. I have now bought a reusable K-cup and can use these coffees in that device.
"I will preface this by saying that I have not tried this coffee.  But the reason I decided not to order is that at 10 grams of coffee per pack and 25 packs per container, it's really expensive.  250 grams =.55 lbs of coffee, which works out to almost $20 per pound. It's a lot cheaper to continue using my Solofill cup to scoop some coffee out of the can.  Just as easy, too!  Solofill cups are great, by the way:-)"
A local Italian restaurant on Cape Cod serves this EVOO for dipping. So good! Finally had to ask what brand is it? It's Unio Siurana. Now we can enjoy it at home as well.
"Ab-so-lute-ly-luv-these!!!Ok you got:- Ole Naples chocolate - goes without saying - mmm mmm.  Creamy and hits that chocolate spot.- Caramel like the old fashioned caramel toffees that are so hard to get these days - Creamy buttery flavour, smooth texture with no congealed/powdery bits that ruin a good caramel.Put them together and you have a chocolate delight that you wont want to share with anyone!  :-)Will be ordering again!"
LOVE the product! This is my 4th time ordering. Always on time and the Chocolate Caramels are to die for!!
These are some of the best chocolate covered caramels I've ever had.  There's no comparison between these and those available at the average grocer.  Well worth the price!
Couldn't be better!  I order these milk and dark chocolate covered soft caramels over and over again from Olde Naples Chocolates.  Soooooo good!!!  And beautifully boxed for gift-giving---if you can dare to give them away...
"This stuff is great!  Believe it or not, it is wonderful spread on crusty bread with a thin slice of blue cheese on top.  Worth the price."
"First let me say this is a wonderful hot sauce.  Spicy, flavorful, a wonderful addition to soups, pizza, etc.  Nice smoky flavor you hope for in a chipotle sauce.  Bargain priced.The bottle design for this thick of a sauce, on the other hand, is an abomination, a work of the devil.  The sauce is typically as thick as ketchup and will only with extreme coaxing exit the long narrow neck of the bottle.  It does not matter how you shake it or where you tap it or how loudly you heap curses upon it.  Your neighbors will wonder what is going on.  The opening is narrow enough that a knife is of little help, which leaves a chopstick as an poor alternative.  And additional perversity is that the sauce will *leak* when I pack it in camping gear!  Perhaps you think I have gotten a lone bad bottle - nooooo, repeated testing and consumption has found the same problem in at least 8 bottles!  I must stop typing now to go reassure my coworkers in neighboring cubicles that I was just putting hot sauce on my pizza and not having a knock down drag out fight steel drum band.sauce = winpackaging = fail"
"Chipotle makes everything taste better.  I first encountered this sauce at a small restaurant in New Mexico and it instantly made everything spicy and smoky.  We made sure to buy a few bottles in a Mexican grocery store, and I've used this on burgers, chicken, etc.  It's awesome.  And it's less than $2.  You can't beat that."
"This Chipotle sauce is really good! I'm not a big fan of hot sauce, but I like this stuff. My spouse loves it and I just had to reorder some more. Good in all kinds of food. Has a nice smoky flavor. Excellent addition to homemade chili (I always add some while cooking it). Order multiple bottles to save on shipping."
This is my favorite out of the chipotle sauces I've tried. It has a delicious taste that resembles barbecue sauce. It goes very well with pizza and mexican food.
"I live in New York where you'd think Mexican hot sauces wouldn't be readily available.  And while it's true that Tabasco Chipotle Hot Sauce is easier to find than this brand, like the original Tabasco sauce, the Tabasco chipotle has too much vinegar and not enough smoky pepper flavor for my taste buds.  That's why I always have a bottle of Cholula (or Tapa Tio), which are red Mexican hot sauces, and a bottle of Bufalo Chipotle in my fridge.  Bufalo's smoky flavor is the best."
"I saw this at my local grocer one day and bought it on a whim.  I did not hold out high hopes but this stuff gave me a very pleasant surprise!The smoky flavor of chipotles is the main star in this sauce of course, and has a lovely tangy/sweet balance.  This sauce is very versatile I have found, being good right out of the bottle with cheeze and crackers, or as a condiment with cooked meats.  The heat is rather mild, allowing you to get as much of the great flavor of this sauce onto your dishes as you wish.I highly recommend this sauce."
"Try it, you'll like it. Insanely great chicken wings.....rich, smokey, chili.....quick chipolte mayo! I'd go on but I've made myself hungry. Just get some."
"I really love this sauce on chicken and rice, eggs, pizza, quesadillas, grilled cheese sandwiches, Steak, Fajitas.I ordered 15 bottles last time to save on shipping, Im down to 5 bottles now and going to order soon, can't believe the price dropped more. $.63 + shipping each. WOW"
"I'm a hot sauce fan, and this is the absolute best chipotle sauce I  have tried.  It is an item I will go out of my way to get.  Very thick sauce, with a smoky chipotle taste.  It is great on nacho's or taco's.  Really a flavor boost."
My absolute favorite chipotle hot sauce. Way better than the tabasco chipotle (though the regular Tabasco is of course a classic).Great stuff and a bargain at $1.95 a bottle.
"While this sauce is acceptably good, (it's neither amazing nor spicy), it lacks any sort of natural ingredients, having a tiny percentage of actual pepper extract. Lot's of other artificial flavors and colors in the mix. Sure, it's cheap, but you get what you pay for. Try the Yucateco version instead, at least it's more natural, and better taste, too."
These were very attractive in person.  I was disappointed because 3 were broken through. Overall they were a good product for thr price.
"These lollipops were so cute and colorful you will love these. there were 4 different colors too, used for a crafting project not for eating."
"Love this tea, and it smells divine!  It definitely put me in the Christmas spirit.  I drink it plain, but I can imagine it could be doctored to resemble Starbuck's Chai Tea with a some sweetener and cream."
"I ordered this chai so I would have something tasty to drink in the evenings during the cold winter months. If you've ever had a rooibos tea you know they are lighter than black teas. But they are still tasty and with Numi's delicious chai spices, this is a wonderful decaf tea to add to your collection. Not to mention it's organic and fair trade. Great tea from a great company!"
I sent several boxes out for Christmas presents and it's one of the only years I ever gotten feedback about my gifts. Everyone I sent it to loved it and reminisced about candy they used to buy when they were a kid. My aunt even said she took a picture of she and her friend wearing the wax lips.  We're talking about two people in their sixties! So it was definitely a big hit.
I was expecting to have lots of candy like the picture did...Wow..not even close.  Small pieces and not all the candy that was listed was in the box.  Very disappointed.
"I enjoyed the Nostalgic Candy assortment greatly, and the product was well packaged without missing or broken candy, and the product arrived in a timely fashion, so I was very pleased with the purchase."
"I was expecting a bunch more candy.  The ad photo is very deceiving!  I wanted something with older candy in it, not the stuff I can buy today. I would not recommend this item to anyone."
"There were a few pieces of candy that were considered ""nostalgic"" but not many that I couldn't get at any store. Also the ""nostalgic"" candy was old and hard. Not like it should be. The price was decent and the delivery of the items was good. Just not impressed with the item."
The majority of this candy was penny type candy.  Very disappointed in the value...although the candy was good Most of the candy can be purchased locally.
"What they fail to mention to everyone is the fact that the candy is all for the decade it was created in. My first piece of candy was an orange tootsie roll. When I bit down I almost broke my teeth it was so rock hard. The product may have been better if it wasn't so old. I also discovered that the small box that I thought was stuffed to the top with candy has paper filler in the bottom. Most of this ""hard to find"" candy can be found at Walmart and various other places for much cheaper prices."
The box was a bit smaller than I thought it would be.I gave it as a hostess gift and She loved it When we opened it we saw that there were a few paper strings for filler but not much it seems it was just used as decoration(thus the smaller box it was filled with candy not a bunch of paper on the bottom)She immediatley had a piece of candy and it was fresh(I saw some reviews that candy was stale) It was a great different hostess gift and i would purchase it again
Great for holiday gift giving when you do not live near the people you're sending to. :-D
The package comes already pre-wrapped to a certain degree. The variety of candy is superb. A+
"I was very disappointed in this candy.  As mentioned in many of the previous reviews, it was cheap penny candy, much of which can be bought at any store today.  I kind of expected that... I mean, they aren't going to produce old candy just for these packages, so they have to still be making them somewhere.What I was really disappointed in was the amount.  The total worth of the candy in the box was maybe $5.  The box was cute, but very tiny.  You would be better to do a little research and put together your own box, with 3-4 times the amount for the same money."
I simply enjoyed reliving the days again when I was a young girl with this nostalgic candy package. It was simply everything I expected and more! I would recommend it to others and order it again!
"I bought this one since there was a great discount on Amazon. But after ate them, we love it so much. It is the best roast peanuts on the market I have ever try. Believe me, you will love it at the first time."
"Do not buy this product. The ingredients are different from those listed on the website.Only purchase if you like MSG, corn syrup and natural flavor!This is a list of the actual ingredients:PeanutsSea SaltSugarCornstarchMonosodium glutamate (MSG)GelatinTorula yeastCorn syrup solidsPaprikaOnion and garlic powdersSpicesNatural flavor"
"I always enjoyed these, and will buy more, but they do come in a jar, as it says, which is glass, not plastic.  Just so you know."
"These Planters peanuts are quite good, but I ordered them without knowing that they contained more than just plain, dry roasted peanuts.  Although theere is no noticeable taste, these peanuts contain sugar, cornstarch, msg, paprika, garlic and onion powder, and other spices.  I have four jars of them and to be honest, I am enjoying eating them, but I would not order them again.  I do a lot of Asian cooking in which peanuts are used quite frequently and I thought I'd save time by not having to open the shells of peanuts bought in a bag, so I took a shortcut in ordering these and it was a mistake."
I absolutely LOVE mango Juice my package arrived pretty quick and tasted delicious. It was sweet and tasted as if I squeezed the mango myself.
"Every now and then I like to give my son a treat of a ""boxed juice"" and this is the only thing I will give him. It is organic, fairly priced, and nutritious. I will keep purchasing this item again and again!"
"After trying, and hating, so many organic juices, this one is a clear winner for my 9 year old. It tastes as great as the juices we were previously buying but with the added piece of mind of being organic."
"My kids love it, even the older ones, and I like the fact that it's organic.  We've purchased it several times.  The fruit punch is good as well!"
I think Amazon.com has a very good selection of organic foods and drinks and i would highly recommend it. Its better for our children.
"it's nice to know that the juice is organic and not from conventionally grown apples(which has pesticides, junky fertilizers etc.). you really can't tell the difference from this and the regular apple juice, which may be a good thing for my kids. all in all i'm pleased with the purchase."
My Maltese and Cavalier King Charles love these treats!  I feel good about feeding them a healthier treat.Not made in China!
"My puppy just loves these treats.  Unfortunately, they are getting hard to find locally and I'm hoping that Amazon will keep selling them.  From the labeling, it would appear that they are healthy which is also getting to be rare since many other dog treats are coming from China with tainted ingredients.  We owners who care about our pets need to be extremely vigilant and only buy safe, healthy products.  Thank you, Amazon for providing them."
"My family loves this.  I use it  cooking, we sprinkle it on just about everything that we eat.  One of the best Cajun seasonings that I have used."
This tea is absolutely delicious!  I stumbled upon it a few years ago and it is my favorite!  It also was the only tea that I drank while I was pregnant because it settled my nausea and is organic and is caffeine-free!!  The flavor is so light and delicious!  Just a dab of sugar (or not) is all it needs!  Very fragrant tea!  Thank you Davidson's!
was surprised to see how many cordials you get for one pound.  - not very many!  taste is wonderful with liquid sweetness in every bite.  yum!  shipped fast
THESE ARE THE BEST OUR FAMILY HAS EVER HAD.  WE ALWAYS GET A COUPLE OF POUNDS FOR THE CHRISTMAS HOLIDAYS.  WE'LL BE GETTING MORE SOON.  DELICIOUS!!
"Although this item was being sent to the southwest, there was no effort to ensure it would arrive safely.  They did not include any cold pack, and it took a week to get here, so you can imagine the mushy ball of chocolate goo that arrived.  I love these rum balls, but it is difficult to enjoy them when they are in either a state of globy mess, or one solid piece."
"These almonds are very good with a slight zing of citrus lime in the favor.  I was surprised that the chili flavor to me was not as bold as I expected. Some of the Blue Diamond bold flavors like the Wasabi and Soy flavors are just, WOW, bold and overpowering.  This flavor while it was good it is milder and I didn't get a hint of a lot of chili until a minute or so after eating a few.  Even then it seems mild when compared to some of the other bold flavors.One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.This flavor has only 5% of your daily intake of sodium. The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you.I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them.  This is still a great flavor and I like them!"
"These almonds are very tasty and popular at my workplace. If you've had wasabi peas, you'll probably like these too. ""BOLD"" is a bit of an overstatement, as these almonds are not as intense as the peas with the nasal burn, but still do have a bit of kick. I wouldn't say the soy sauce flavor is that apparent, though, but I'm not counting that against the product.Most wasabi-flavored snacks really contain horseradish because it is a cheaper substitute. Wasabi is notoriously difficult to cultivate and the chemicals that give it its characteristic pungency are volatile.I like these a whole lot and routinely buy several cans of them from my drugstore whenever they are on sale. My mom's factory wo-workers like these too. However, I took this to a baseball game and it was almost universally hated. Go figure!"
"I love these Blue Diamond Almond snacks and I particularly like the bold flavors.  This flavor is very good and the smoky BBQ taste just sets off the flavor of the crunchy almond that it coats.  I like an evening snack while I read a book and these for me are just so much better than chips and other snack foods.  It gives you a chance to snack but still eat healthy.One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat.  You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones.  I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.This flavor does have 7% of your daily intake of sodium and if you are on a salt restricted diet then make sure to watch your salt intake.  The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away.This is a very good product and I recommend it to you!"
"Rather than just eat chips for a snack I love the Blue Diamond Almond snacks.  This is one of my favorite flavors and the only problem is that they are hard to stop eating.  They have a nice rich smoky flavor and the jalapeno is just enough of a spicy kick to make these almonds taste better.The nice thing about this treat is that they have only 1 gram of sugar while giving you 6 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber.  They are a healthy snack and you get Vitamin E, magnesium and calcium in every serving.  This particular flavor does have 180 mg of Sodium (7% of a daily 2000 calories diet) per serving but they really taste good!  Just make sure that you only count our 28 almonds and eat one portion for 170 calories.  It is really hard to do and they taste so darn good!"
"I love Blue Diamond Almonds and this bold flavor gives you a spicy hot choice for a snack.  They are rich in vitamin E, magnesium and calcium while only being 170 calories for one serving.  They also add 3 grams of dietary fiber to your diet and 6 grams of protein while only adding 2 grams of sugar.They do contain 15 grams of fat but only 1 gram of saturated fat and 0 grams of trans fat. (Mostly they are the good stuff)  If you want a quick snack that is high in protein and low in sugar and sodium these are pretty good and spicy.While there are other flavors that I like more this one is still very good.  Just remember, they are addictive so you only get one serving!"
I love these.  I bring them to work for a between meal snack.  They are bold and really take the edge off my hunger.
"I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I've never seen the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor at the local grocery store so when I saw them on Amazon I decided to buy them.I'm pleased to say that I wasn't disappointed. This is right up there with my favorite flavors. It has just enough heat and jalapeno flavor with just a little bit of smoke. To me, these have almost as much heat as the Habanero flavor. Which isn't a bad thing. I like spicy.I would defiantly recommend these if you like the Bold line of Blue Diamond Almonds."
"The heat here is very very mild. I've had habanero sauces and chips that were so hot they made me cry for help. These are not like that. Only occasionally will you get a little kick. It's actually mostly tangy and tomato-y. The dusting of flavoring on the outside of the nuts will coat your fingers in an orange film.Satisfyingly crunchy and tangy, it's really hard to stop eating these. Even though the habanero kick isn't there as promised on the label, it's still really tasty. I highly recommend these. Sodium content is very low at 4% per serving. High in Vitamin E (35%) and magnesium (20%). This 1 pound bag (x3 bags) is a great deal compared to buying the 6 oz tins at the store, however, when my local Walgreens has buy 1 get 1, the price drops to about $0.35/oz.Blue Diamond makes about 8 other flavors that I know of. My favorites are the Soy Wasabi, Honey Roasted, Smokehouse, Dijon Mustard."
"I'm a big fan of the Blue Diamond brand almonds and I especially like the ""bold"" flavors.The Lime n Chili flavor is my favorite with the Habanero BBQ being a close second.I agree with another reviewer that says the tartness of the lime flavor is just enough to bring out the chili flavor. Its a nice balance.I would say my only complaint is towards the end of the bag the flavor can get a little overwhelming because of all the extra spices that accumulate towards the bottom."
these taste amazing. might make the poops burn a little :o but they taste amazing. the salt and vinegar ones are the best and very addicting.
"When I first tried these tasty almonds, I was amazed at the great marriage of flavor. Has the kick of wasabi, and the sweet taste of roasted almonds. The first one is an eye opener each time even after you have had them many times. Bold and fun! If you like sushi, and you enjoy the taste of wasabi, these are for you."
"Diamond AlmondsAlmonds are a good source of magnesium.

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong.

"Not a big fan of chili actually... so these almonds are perfect!  ok sounds weird right!!??  What i am saying is that i LOVE LIME, and these almonds are mostly lime with a very subtle hint of chili n spice as an after thought... PERFECTION!"

"The flavor of these is just amazing. They are really addicting. They are slightly spicy, but they shouldn't be too spicy for anyone's palette. My 6 year old son really enjoys these, too. My suggestion is to open the 1 pound bag and pour a serving or two into separate containers for snacking. If you eat directly from the 1 pound bag, you are likely to eat the entire thing in one sitting because they are so addicting. I've also tried the Jalepeno Smokehouse and the Salt & Vinegar flavors from Blue Diamond. The Jalepeno Smokehouse are actually a little spicier than the Habanero BBQ if you're wondering. Compare the price per ounce on these and you will see they are the most affordable."
"I was concerned that these might be too hot, 'Habanero', but the heat is perfect as is the flavor... they are bold, if you like stuff plain--these are not for you... but if you like a robust flavor, a definite must!  Took some to the office and my office is all addicted by these now, you can't eat just one.  From a texture perspective, they are perfectly roasted - not chewy and not powdery, they are crisp.  I'm on a Paleolithic 'Paleo' diet and nuts like these are okay for me to eat - so they make a great treat.  I've gone through 7 bags in 3 months (sharing, of course)... I definitely recommend."
"This is the best product Blue Diamond sells, at least in my book. Spicy bbq flavor, like eating chips, but a much healthier alternative. You will not be sorry for buying these. I order these all the time, great deal on 3 pkg of 1 lb bags. YUM  PS:I am on atkins in the maintenance mode and miss chips, this is the replacement I was looking for: Far less carbs."
These are sooo great tasting and the individual  packaging is  great to get them handy around. Perfect buy to stock up as the individual packets are rare to find and there are many favors available however this one is my favorite.
Love these almonds!  Great flavor -- really hits the spot when those mid-afternoon hunger cravings set in! You won't be disappointed with this purchase!
"I used to buy the highly spiced and addictive Wasabi peas from an Asian grocery. They went great with beer. But the crunchiness of the dried peas got to me and my husband after a while, so we stopped getting them. When I run across Blue Diamond Bold Wasabi & Soy Sauce Almonds, I was ecstatic. Now I could once again enjoy the taste of Wasabi as well as enjoy the health benefits of almonds at the same time.You can tell that these almonds are flavored as they have a powdery coating. I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.5 star snack!"
The taste is perfect. Smoky with just enough heat to let you know it is there. These don't have 5 alarm heat if that's what you are looking for. These almonds are perfectly seasoned and very addicting. Great if you are on a ketogenic or low carb diet.
"Hello everyone, I just had to write a review for these Wasabi and Soy Sauce flavored Blue Diamond Almonds, because I enjoy them sooooooo much! I am a bit of a wasabi junkie as I love sushi with plenty of soy sauce & wasabi, wasabi flavored shrimp chips, and tuna sandwiches made with wasabi mayonnaise, but my new wasabi flavored favorite are these Wasabi and Soy Sauce Almonds from Blue Diamond. The flavor is fantastic, as it is spicy but not so much to bring tears to your eyes. Also, the price of this product is great as well. Sometimes when my money is tight, and sushi is a little too pricey, I like to buy these almonds as an cheaper alternative, to satisfy my wasabi craving. Treat yourself to these awesome almonds today!"
"The Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds taste great and are a nice healthy option for a snack. The flavor is bold, but not overpowering or ""hot."" I also think they would be excellent chopped up and added to a salad."
"If you love almonds - especially Blue Diamond Almonds, these are great!  It is like Blue Diamond Almonds on steroids.  They are not incredibly spicy, but they have a little zip and a good amount of flavor.  A better buy than the Habanero BBQ ones for sure.  I would buy them again and they are great with a cold beer."
"These are excellent. The flavor is strong and pleasant. I think the package size is perfect for snacking.Besides general use, I recommend these if you go to a desert; these make you want to drink more, which is important as it is easy to get dehydrated and not notice it in desert environment."
"I am addicted to sushi, which is an expensive addiction.  I always keep a tin of these at work and at home to satisfy the craving.  My boyfriend, who doesn't like sushi, really enjoys these too, so they aren't just for sushi lovers.  I believe they are roasted, so they are not as healthy as raw almonds, but they still make a great afternoon snack."
These things are great. Perfect size bag for an afternoon snack. If you like salt and vinegar flavor you will like these.
"The ""Jalapeno Smokehouse"" flavor is the best flavor in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" series, hands down. Unlike some of the other flavors, this one really tastes like what it's supposed to taste like -- that is to say, smoky jalapeno peppers. To my jaded taste buds, the pepper spice is fairly mild, but I imagine most people find it packs quite a kick. It's a good thing these huge, perfectly roasted nuts are great for you, because I eat them constantly. Hey, my HDL cholesterol (the ""good"" cholesterol) has actually risen as I've gotten older. I like to think it's partly because of these luscious babies. Dr Jeddy prescribes a handful every day!"
"I'm addicted to Blue Diamond almonds. I've tried all the flavors -- and this was the last one I tried. I love salt, I love vinegar, and I love salt-and-vinegar potato chips, so how could I lose with these?Well, I'm just not that into them. The flavor's great and the almonds are fresh, but somehow the texture just fails. The almonds just seem... soggy. They don't have that wonderful crunch that the other Blue Diamond flavors have. And that flattens out the whole experience of eating them. I've eaten about 10 bags so far, and they all have the same lackluster texture.Oh well. Guess even my ol' reliable Blue Diamond can't hit it out of the park every time."
"I don't know what they put in these things, but whatever it is it's addictive. The combination of soy sauce salty and wasabi spicy create the perfect storm of ""I'm going to eat this entire can RFN.""The cans are all perfectly sealed and the almonds are always fresh - what else can you ask for? The cost is also lower than in local stores, but you can buy the larger bags cheaper (per oz) from some Walmarts if you can find them.Almonds are supposed to be appetite suppressants, but for me it's usually because I ate an entire can of them and am not hungry any more."
"I gave half of the 6 pack to my friend visiting from Tokyo. We both love them. Although, it would be nice if they came in bigger cans."
"Before we switched to eating low carb, we used to LOVE a nice big bag of chips.  I was missing those zesty salty crunchy snacks, until we found these delicious almonds!  I have tried all of the flavors and love them all, but these are my current favorite.  I like the snack size packs as a reminder that I have had enough since I can never stop eating them (just like potato chips, no one can eat just one).  A whole package is only  8 grams of carbs (only 4 grams of net carbs if you are an Atkins dieter).  These almonds have a nice crisp texture (even better if you put them in the refrigerator for a bit) and the seasoning is evenly distributed.  Not to strong, but also not too weak that it gets lost on the almonds. A package of 12 only lasted about a week in our home, back to order more."
"These are better than chips -- you can't eat just one!  Seriously, great snack when you're on the run."
"If you love salt & vinegar chips like I do, these are for you.  Great salty snack, high in protein, pretty filling, and without the grease of potato chips. Definitely recommend!"
The product arrived on time and fresh and this was the only place that I have found this tasty snack.  I would buy them again.
"While trying to cut back on carbs, and add more protein to my diet, I discovered this wonderful tasty snack.  At 260 calories, even this 1.5 oz pack is too much for a snack, but I divide the packs in half again and have a healthy snack that helps satisfy my hunger in the late afternoon.  They're also good as a breakfast on the run. The wasabi adds a wonderful punch-love them!"
Too good to last. Next thing I know it's all gone.  Everyone in the family loved it. You can't go wrong with Blue Diamond.
"Not generally a big fan of wasabi or of almonds, but somehow find these particular wasabi and soy sauce almonds to be a healthy addiction. My doctor recommended almonds as an excellent low-carb, high protein, high fiber snack with heart healthy fat and this flavor is great to meet that suggestion while providing a nice savory and spicy snack with a little salty crunch.  A little bit spicy but not too much (I don't tolerate really spice foods well).  I tried the smokehouse flavor by the same brand and didn't like it, but I could live on these wasabi and soy sauce almonds. The soy sauce flavor is hardly noticeable but just nicely tones down the heat of the wasabi."
"I've been participating in Weight Watchers for the last couple months (doing well).  I like to have a healthy snack at work mid-afternoon so I bought a bag of these at the grocery store.  They are so good I can't stop at 23 (a serving size).  I am not going to buy these again until I'm at my goal because I can't stop eating them.  They are quite salty so if you are trying to control your sodium, beware.  They are not as ""hot"" as wasabi peas, a more gentle kick.  I highly recommend them. Very savory."
WOW.  so many salt and vinegar snacks disappoint... i've only ever been satisfied by herr's... everyone else seems to be pretty weak.in steps blue diamond almonds with their take on salt 'n vinegar... i just received my shipment and i can't leave these things alone!  i'm going to get another order later in the year & give them out as christmas presents =]
"These are the tastiest of all the Blue Diamond flavors out there, in my opinion!  Just the right combination of vinegar sourness and salty goodness.Plus they're a very healthy low-carb snack.  The tin is just the right size, and the lid keeps them fresh for a few weeks (not that they tend to last that long!)"
I really enjoy the Jalapeno flavor.  The Wasabi flavor was just a step behind that.  But this lime and chili flavor...I think I would only enjoy it with a beer.  The lime flavor is just way to intense.  I will not be ordering this flavor again.
I absolutely love these nuts! I can't find them where I live so I will continue to order these from Amazon. They are well worth the price.
"Better tasting then just about any potato chip and tons healthier too, especially for low carb diets. These things are just amazing. The lime and chili flavors are equally bold and complement the flavor of the almond quite nicely. Highly recommended.  They have some other flavors that may be worth trying too."
"Eaten alone these flavored almonds are a bit overpowering (pretty tart, but I love 'em). However, if you put them in a large container with other flavored nuts, such as lime 'n chili, along with raw almonds, cashews, walnuts whatever, the spices are spread among all the other nuts. A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want."

A great snack. It was also cheaper and easier to get them through Amazon than to run all over town trying to find a store that carries the flavors I want."
"I could live off of these things, they are soooo good!  I usually get mine at the supermarket, but this 6-pack deal is a great idea for addicts like myself.  I guess the wasabi flavor is a bit weak, but that's perfect for me because although I love the flavor of horseraddish, it destroys my sinuses! lol"
These have a great combination of salt and vinegar which makes neither aspect overwhelming. They are insanely addictive and they go well with dried fruits like raisins to give some contrast to the salt. They are also high in fiber which makes up for their fat content to some extent.
"I love these.  They have exactly the right amount of spice/flavoring (which is probably too much) and I used to buy the 1.5oz package daily with lunch, but buying them in bulk makes so much more sense.  Yum!  The empty cans are good for storing loose hardware and small things around the house."
"Found these by accident - they are so tasty. Very hard to find in local grocery stores, so I was happy to find them on Amazon.com.  Will probably be ordering more.4/2/11 - I have since bought 3 more cases. I took some to work and everyone wanted to know where I got them. They asked me to sell them some when I get another shipment."
"This particular flavor of Blue Diamond almonds generally doesn't show up in grocery stores in this size cans. The occasional quick shop/gas station may carry them in the small bags. I travel and I look every time. It may not be everybody's favorite, but I'm sure glad I can get them in bulk."
We love these packages -- perfect for backpacks or as a traveling snack.  We will purchase them again!
"I am so thrilled to find these on Amazon! I don't know why it didn't occur to me to look earlier. I love salt and vinegar potato chips and these definitely hit the same flavor spot. But it's a much healthier alternative. They are still high in fat, as all nuts are, so eating a whole can in one sitting is probably not the thing to do. But a handful in the afternoon really takes care of my salt craving, the bold vinegar flavor makes a little go a long way and I'm getting some good nutrients too. As others mentioned, of all the ""bold"" flavors, this seems to be the one that is hardest to find in stores. Thank you, Amazon!"
My husband absolutely loves these.  He's self-employed and spends alot of time on the road - takes apples and these nuts with him.  He's even given them away at the jobsites and the guys all love them.  Great product and the free shipping is a real plus!
"I recently discovered the Salt & Vinegar Almonds they are delicious. The individual size is perfect for when on the go. I also purchased the cans for at home. Almonds are a very heart healthy snack, just try to limit yourself to a few a day. For my taste I would like to have more vinegar flavor."
"I love salt and vinegar chips, but never feel full even if I eat a whole bag.  (and I will!!!)  I thought the idea of salt and vinegar almonds sounded gross, but was willing to give it a try.  And boy they are great!  They have about twice the vinegar punch of most chips, and are amazingly good, and the fat is the good kind, and you get plenty full on the almonds.  Mmmmmm.I was buying the tins (which are sometimes available at the grocery store), but then realized I couldn't stop once I opened a tin and was eating something like 1,200 calories in a single day just on almonds.  So these packs are perfect - there are enough almonds to really satisfy a hungry stomach, but not so much to blow your diet.  And they're great to stash when you know that you won't be able to grab a real meal, but don't want to find yourself at a vending machine or 7Eleven buying crap b/c you're so hungry.  Even my (naturally thin) hubby loves them.  Perfect!"
I discovered that this particular flavor wakes me right up for the long drive home after dark.
I ordered some of these and literally ate them each day through all 24 packs.  They are addicting and delicious.
"These almonds are the most wonderfully satisfying snack ever. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds then you will absolutely love these nuts. I have had trouble finding them locally, so when I find them, I stock up. These 1.5 ounce bags are a perfect size to include in my husbands lunch."
"I love these nuts and it seems that most stores carry all flavors but the Jalapeno, I won't hesitate to order these again if I cannot find them next time, gotta have 'em!!!"
"These are great! As a lover of all chips I'm so happy to find a healthy alternative.It's a great, flavorful snack."
"Almonds are one of the most healthy, satisfying foods you can find.  These are nice and spicy with the right snack size.  I debated getting these or the big tins, but the small bags helps me control the overeating and mindless snack munching."
Enjoyable all times of the day. Just the right amount of salt and flavor. This is becoming a favorite in my house. I also take it to work to satisfy that afternoon craving.
These are not easy to find in stores...and one must be diligent to keep them on hand! They do not create sores from acidity...they are better than any salt and vinegar chip I ever tasted. Highly recommend. Even better...new individual packets you can throw in your purse have been seen!
"This flavor is the best of the bunch by far.  I am reluctantly on a diet that allows for a few almonds as a snack.  I tried these and I was hooked.  Unfortunately, most stores do not carry this flavor.  My first case went very quickly, as every co-worker who tried them wanted a can of their own.  I recommend them to anyone, not only those of us trying to stick to a diet that deprives us of less healthy snacks."
Our order arrived yesterday and this morning we placed an order for more - the taste is addictive!!  Just enough punch and spice.
"I've tried smokehouse, jalapeno smokehouse, honey roast, lime and chili, and natural. But these are really the best of the lot I've tried. They have the nice fresh-tasting almonds you expect from Blue Diamond, and you can actually taste the wasabi (unlike the jalapeno smokehouse, where the jalapeno part is really elusive).I was reluctant at first to try this. Didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong. Terrific snack almonds (if you don't mind saltiness). Love em.Mir"
"Even though I (thought) I hated them for 25 years, I am a recent convert to the great taste and nutritional value of almonds. It is hard to find a quality almond. Some are too hard, some are too ""dry,"" some are too plain. Without a doubt, Blue Diamond produces the best-tasting almonds. I have had many different brands of almonds and if you are eating them out of the bag (IE, not cooking with them or mixing them with something), quality can go a long way. Blue Diamond almonds are very flavorful on their own. I typically do not like a completely plain almond, so decided to try their Bold series.The Bold Series has several different flavors. Some of these are hit and miss with me. Some of the flavors are ""too"" bold, and some taste great the first few almonds, but quickly overwhelm you. Since my favorite Blue Diamond product is <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000ZSX4D2"">Blue Diamond Almonds Roasted Salted, 6-Ounce Tins (Pack of 12)</a>, I thought I would give these a try.  I have been disappointed with other products within their Bold line, but these aren't too bad.You can definitely taste the salt and vinegar, and it's pretty much the same amount of flavor you would find with Salt and Vinegar potato chips.  Normally, I can eat half a can of Blue Diamond almonds in one sitting, however the strong flavor of the vinegar overwhelms me a bit and I can usually only eat half a serving of these at once.  If you're a big Salt and Vinegar fan however, these shouldn't be a problem.  While the Salt and Vinegar Almonds aren't my favorite in the Bold line, I do like them much better than the other varieties, and will probably get them again.  If you've never tried them before, you may want to start with purchasing just one can rather than 12."
"I wanted more wasabi flavor but there is enough for a good balanced taste. Really, they are pretty good. You can actually find these in walmart for $3 a can so its about the same as buying here."
these are the best flavor - very nice lime/chile taste goes great with the almonds. i agree with ms.cox!
"I'll start off by noting that I love almonds, I eat almonds every day, and I particularly love Blue Diamond almonds. The most important qualities of almonds, for me, are freshness, quality, and careful roasting. Blue Diamond almonds get 5 stars on all those parameters.And I've tried all their flavors, especially their ""BOLD"" line. Alas, their definition of ""BOLD"" is apparently ""a little too spicy for kids."" This flavor is okay, as a change of pace, but doesn't exactly set my taste buds a-""blazin'."" It doesn't taste like Buffalo wings -- it's too sweet and not vinegary enough. And it's definitely not spicy enough. I realize that real Buffalo wing spice can be brutal, and might not suit a mass-market snacking product. But really, they haven't even tried here. There's not even a hint of Tabasco, for example.As I said, this is a pleasant enough flavor, especially if you need a little change from, say, my favorite, <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Jalapeno Smokehouse</a>. But it doesn't taste much like anything in particular. They could have called it ""BOLD Generic Faux-Spicy Snack to be Eaten Brainlessly While Watching the Game"" flavor and it would have been more accurate."
"Ordered these because I wanted to try them and none of the stores in my area seem to carry them. Normally I eat the habanero bbq or the wasabi.For spiciness they are better than the habanero but not as much as the wasabi can be (though in all fairness the wasabi is in a whole different taste spectrum anyway)Flavorwise is where they lose out. They taste MUCH saltier and the flavor itself is overpowered by that until you get to the end zing where the spice kicks in.In summary, they are edible and I will finish off the cans that I ordered but I will go back to purchasing my wasabi and habanero after that."
"I went out on a limb trying Blue Diamond Almonds Bold - Wasabi & Soy flavor.  I had never had wasabi before, but I have like many of the other ""Bold"" flavors Blue Diamond makes (Jalapeno Smokehouse and Habanero BBQ) so I decided to give them a try.  The flavor is definitely bold.  It reminds me of the horseradish flavor that is common in many deli mustards.  It has grown on me over time, but I would like to see a little more balance with the ""soy"" flavor.  This is where I like the other flavors that I mentioned better as I think these are bold but better balanced.  If you love wasabi or horseradish, this will probably be right up your alley.  Combine that with almonds being one of the healthier snack options, and you've good a good treat.  Much like the other flavors, the bold flavor makes moderation fairly easy as I could not imagine going overboard on these.  Enjoy!"
"To start, I'm a big fan of Blue Diamond brand Almonds. I really like the bold flavors, Habanero BBQ and Lime & Chili. I had never seen the Blazin' Buffalo Wing flavor at the local grocery store so I ordered them here on Amazon.When you first put an almond in your mouth you get the initial hint of buffalo wing flavor but it quickly goes away and then just tastes kind of strange.They aren't bad but they aren't my favorite. Every bodies taste buds are different so you might like them but I don't think I'll buy this flavor again."
"I love the product, they have great taste, easy to order and we did not have a long wait time to recieve them. I will order again."
"This product was delivered on time, but I can not say that it was worth the money.  When you look at the price per oz. it becomes much more expensive than you think."
"My fav bold BD almond by far. Completely addicting. TY Lord that they are pretty expensive. Not the best nut though. That distinction, of course, goes to Mauna Loa garlic and onion fav Mac."
"It took two or three cans, but I love these now.  When I first tried these, I thought the taste was not as ""bold"" as I would like it to be.  I do wish they were a tad stronger and hotter on the wasabi taste, but I am hooked on these now.  I eat some almost every day."
"These have no bite at all...Nothing. They should scratch off the ""Wasabi"" from the label... on the verge of false advertisibg...""Bold""...My behind...the only reason for 2 stars is that they are at least Almonds...."
"These almonds aren't bad--better than just eating regular salted almonds.  But I tried the Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds first, and I like those a LOT more than the Wasabi & Soy.  I found that I got a stronger ""kick"" from the horseradish if I sucked on the almond first before eating it."
"I didn't like these.I guess it's my fault for not liking them, because I actually have never tried wasabi, but I like asian flavors in food and adore all of Blue Diamond's bold flavors, so when I saw this in the store, I was like hey why not.Now I know why not. These nuts were horrific...they had this...harsh acerbic taste to them that I just could not enjoy. I ended up wiping most of the flavoring off and chopping the nuts up to put in stuff like salads. The nuts themselves are high quality and always taste fresh, so at least I was able to get some use from them. However, I would never  buy these again and if you are not experienced with wasabi, you may want to think twice before buying them lol."
"The wasabi flavor was not as strong as I like. I have had others (in the large 39 ounce plastic jar from Costco that were better, but they are no longer available.  These are an adequate substitute.  The smaller container is handy.PK"
I used to love the smokehouse almonds but the last few cans I bought SUCKED! Bland with little flavor.  Does anyone know if they changed ingredients or recipes or something?
"The cans are teeny tiny, and for what they charge it's just not worth the expense. Also, I really hate how they charge different prices for different flavors. That is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. The product itself is yummy, just not happy about the prices."
"I picked up a can of these after the glowing reviews I read for it. To keep it short, it has a very authentic wasabi taste. It literally tastes like an almond dipped in wasabi sauce. And that, to me, doesn't make the most appealing snack. I find the wasabi flavor overwhelming, and none of the soy flavor coming through. I thought it'd come through as a more balanced flavor, but that's not the case. I won't be eating anymore, personally. I gave it two stars since it is wasabi flavor, and it certainly tastes like that."
"Tastes like a poor Ranch fav almond. Barely any lime. What are these 5 star reviewers eatting anyway. Proably the wasaibi and soy bold BD almonds. Save your money and calories, do not buy these. Buy extra wasaibi."
"I deserved to get a nasty product when I selected a product flavored with Wasabi and Soy Sauce.  If you really like Wasabi and Soy Sauce, buy this product.  The nuts are of a high quality."
"I'd been buying it for years WHEN I COULD FIND IT, at the local grocery. Generally buying 5 or 6 cans cause I couldn't be sure it would be there next time I went. As such, I was thrilled to see Amazon selling it in bulk and cheaper than at my local store.These are almonds... so you get the health benefits of that. They are very tasty, with a mild wasabi tang... I've shared them with friends and they love them.Granted, these don't provide the entertainment value of the wasabi peas from the Japanese place that blow out your sinuses. But Its still a very tasty, semi healthy (lots of salt), snack that fills my need for something crunchy.MUCH healthier than potato chips."
"This is one of my favorites in the Blue Diamond ""BOLD"" flavors line. There's a nice balance of heat vs sweet, and the saltiness isn't overwhelming. You can eat 'em by the handful, and probably will once you taste them. However, true hot-pepper fans know that the heat of the Habanero pepper is a fearsome thing. You won't find much of it here, just a little hint. That's probably for the best, given that most people can't tolerate the blazing intensity of those devilish little peppers. But I kind of wish Blue Diamond would put out a ""BOLD, and This Time We Mean It"" line for those of us who really do love spicy foods."
"OH MY WORD!! I love these, I love the bold flavored Blue Diamond almonds. Love this flavor first, then the wasabi then the salt vinegar. The Wasabi has a gram or so more of carbs, so I generally choose this one or the salt and vinegar. The problem for me is I'm an addict. If I got 3 pounds of these almonds, I'd eat 3 pounds of these almonds in short order. That being said. They are delicious, salty, a little spicy with a touch of sweeet - they are fantastic! This price is better than I get them at Wally World for the 6oz can and they are cheaper there than anywhere else. So, buy these, buy them now and hide the other bags from yourself (or send them to me) ...they are SO good, I'm eating them now! :Hey Amazon, this is sold and shipped by you, it would be ever so nice if this came on the subscribe and save!"
These taste great but aren't even as spicy as something that would be labeled jalapeno. I will still buy these but if you are expecting spicy don't be surprised for mild.
"Wasabi!  Almonds!  What's not to love?  Can't stop eating these, glad they come in packs of six..."
"Blue Diamond Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are a great snack.  Almonds are one of the healthiest nuts that you can eat, and the Jalapeno Smokehouse flavor is very similar to chipotle.  This isn't too surprising since a chipotle is a smoked jalapeno after all.  From a nutrition stand point, the only special consideration that doesn't come will all almonds is the 180 mg of sodium per serving.  Unless you get a plain, unsalted nut this is pretty typical.  I like to keep a can of these either in my desk or in the pantry at home for snacking.  Grabbing a handful of these is great between meals when hunger strikes.  So if you are looking for a spicy snack that is fairly healthy, give these a try."
"I just tried these for the first time last night...and wow, what a product! The lime and chili combination for these almonds is AMAZING. The flavor is INTENSE, powerful and oh, so delicious!! I am going to buy a bunch more of these to snack on, and I have to say, I will be snacking on THESE almonds for a long time to come. And seriously - I'm salivating while I write this!! I'm going to go eat some right now!"
These are great! I can't stop eating these! The amount of wasabi flavor was perfect for me. I am definitely going to have to try the other flavors
I absolutely love these salt and vinegar almonds!!!Being a fan of salt and vinegar potato chips when I saw these I knew I had to try them. Finished off the can within a couple days!! These are truly very good!!  My only problem is I couldn't find them again in any store around here so I remembered my fav place to shop Amazon.com and knew they wouldn't fail me! Thank you!!
first of all -- they're good.  really good.  go back for more and lick the bowl when they're gone - good.That said -- they're not quite as bold as you might hope.  I mean -- I'm from Texas.  Bold should be really BOLD.  But they are good -- so we'll just overlook it.  Yummy.And they are almonds -- one of those wonder nuts so full of B vitamins and other good stuff that you should be eating an ounce a day just for health sake.  But they're good enough that it's not exactly an intelligence test whether you'll want to eat them.

"These almonds are my favorite flavor from Blue Diamond. Not too sweet, not too spicy. More sweet than spicy though so I wouldn't be afraid of getting it even if you can't normally handle spicy foods."
these almonds are totally addictive!!!  and deeeelicious!the best way to buy them that i've found is through this deal.  costs way more in stores.
"I love sensational flavors and these almonds really deliver.They get sprinkled on many of my Thai dishes, stir fries, and fried rice medleys for extra crunch, calcium, fiber, and protein."
"I don't know what the other person is talking about, these nuts are delicious!  Granted they're not your organic, all natural stuff, but what did you expect from a fusion buffalo wing almond!"
"Seriously, these things are delicious.  Amazon is a great place to buy them too.  At my local grocer they are $6 a can.  Can't go wrong!"
"These are great, and I love the bulk purchase with Amazon. Worst danger is that you want to eat more than you should because they are really very good."
These are gggrrreeeaattt tasting almonds! Got these directly from Amazon and glad I did as they are a bit tough to find around here. Nice spice to them!
These almonds are very tasty.  I eat them alone and sometimes mix them with plain Greek yogurt for a delicious and healthy treat.  You can't find this flavor in most stores and the typical Blue Diamond can is much more expensive else where.
"I am so thankful that Amazon has these wonderful almonds! Our WalMarts used to carry them and made a big mistake discontinuing them. There are six people in my office alone that LOVE these Jalapeno almonds and we have looked everywhere for them! I hope we will always be able to find them here!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001EQ4QJK"">Blue Diamond Almonds, Bold Jalapeno Smokehouse, 6-Ounce Can (Pack of 6)</a>"
"If you like snacks that are a healthier alternative to other options, almonds are a great way to go.  These particular almonds pack a lot of flavor and kick.  They are great for a quick snack that is full of flavor.  They are delicious."
"Wow is what you'll say when chomping on these nuts.  They're very tasty and addictive, as stated in the other reviews.  If you like wasabi or horseradish, you'll love these.  My mom says almonds help you sleep and for the last week I've slept great.  If you like bold flavor, I strongly recommend them."
"I love wasabi....and these almonds are AWESOME!  They taste better than any other ""flavor enhanced"" almonds on the market."
"Regular salted almonds are okay but tend to be boring after awhile.  But Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse almonds are just amazing.  I could eat an entire can in one sitting no problem, probably two cans.  I was tempted to give these nuts just 1 star because I'm afraid they're going to make me fat and broke!  FYI, I also tried the Wasabi & Soy Sauce almonds--absolutely no comparison, the Jalapeno Smokehouse blow them out of the water (at least to my taste buds)."
"Tried the almonds today for the first time.  I'm ordering a case right now.  Best ever, ever, ever!!!"
"These almonds are delicious. When you first start chewing, they taste like the plain Smokehouse brand. After a few seconds the Jalapeno heat kicks in. Not overwhelming but just enough to make the snack wanting you to eat a few more. Only bad part is that they are not available in the 38oz tub or jar like the Habanero BBQ flavor that is a better value. If you like them as I do, you can go through a 6oz can very quickly."
"The title says it all.The wasabi+soy flavors combine to a deliciousness that is out of this world.  If you haven't tried them yet, you're missing out."
"I became hooked on these tasty tidbits, but after a while, I couldn't find them at my local stores anymore.  I tried Amazon and found I could order them in packs of six.  While the price is a little higher than I'd like, that is overridden by the fact that I can indeed get them, and they are delivered right to my door.  Ordering two packs gives me free shipping, too. These almonds are delicious by themselves, but when mixed with dark chocolate, they become irresistible.  The yummy recipe goes like this: take two almonds and one Hershey's dark chocolate kiss.  Pop the two almonds in your mouth and chew a little. Then pop in the chocolate kiss and chew, mixing the two together.  Sheer bliss!  I've become addicted and don't know what I'd do if these flavored almonds ever become unavailable."
"Great flavor. I have always ordered Blue Diamond wasabi almonds but these come in a convenient snack bag I can throw in my purse. My colleagues are always digging around in my purse now because they know I have tasty snacks. So the only drawback is that people want me to share. Which means they are that good! Hey, I should also get a five-star rating for feeding my friends."
These almonds are so yummy! I ordered them online because both of my stores were always out. Walmart and Target is where I get them. I go through these very quickly. I like spicy foods so to me they are not hot but just right.
"Wow! These are amazingly tasty! Addictive, even. I only wish they were easier to find!"
"If you love Salt and Vinegar chips then you can't help but love these almonds, they are sooooooooooooooooooooo good!  Yes, the almonds have fat (much like chips) but at least its a good fat for you!"
"I love salt & vinegar chips and I love Blue Diamond almonds so I was delighted to find a combination of the two.  They make a great snack and a great substitute for chips with a sandwich.  They are a little tart and a little sweet, YUMMY!"
"I have tried most of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and I have to say this one is my FAVORITE!!!  Once I start eating these almonds, it's hard to stop.  YUMMY!!!"

"These almond flavor by this company brand is simply the best by far.  Great flavor that has the essence of true BBQ taste that is not too spicy.  A great snack whenever and wherever,  you may not be able to eat just one.  to tell the truth,  you might find yourself telling people to keep there hands off your nuts.  yummy!"
"Lime and Chili seemed a strange combination but the Lime Flavor is natural, not sweet, just tart enough to bring out the chili spice to create a great tasting nut treat to snack on.  Almonds are a great, fun snack and having one that has a Lime Tart Flavor is absolutely Fabulous.  Even better is that Amazon delivers three full one pound packages for less than the price this item normally retails for in Stores, IF you can even get it in your favorite store."
These things are amazing.  I can't eat less than half a can at a sitting.  Probably my favorite snack right now.
"Blue Diamond almonds are by far my favorite for flavor and texture. My only minimal complaint about these is that they are very minimally spicy. I was afraid to go for Habenero in case they were TOO spicy, but given that these are much more mild than Jalepenos I will go for Habanero next order."
"I would just like to say that this company producing roasted almonds is by far the best tasting almonds I have ever had...they are the perfect most tastiest treat on the go whenever you need one and it is really pleasing to have. Its heart food and I like it. This will be a staple snack for me FOREVER :D if anyone in the company reads this comment, I really encourage you to make a WIDE ARRAY of flavors...it would be very interesting and unique. You guys have A LOT of good ones now..but imagine other possibilities. GO AT IT :D!!!"
"The Blue Diamond Jalapeno Smokehouse Almonds are great tasting, with a strong smoky flavor and a nice jalapeno bite. These have a decent amount of spicy heat to them, but it isn't too overpowering. My wife picked these up for a long road trip and they were the first snack to get finished up.Highly Recommended!CFH"
"Great BBQ flavor with enough Habanero to give it a nice little kick.  The flavors are not overwhelming, so the taste of the almond still shines through.  A really nice snack that's just a little different."
"These Salt and Vinegar Almonds are one of the best snack foods I have ever tasted!  They're just tangy enough to give you a good kick.  Hard to find in my local stores, so I came to Amazon and bought a case  :-)"
"I like lime and I like chili so I figured this would be a pretty tasty nut. It is definitely very flavorful but the lime overpowers the chili so much that the chili might as well be nonexistent. So if you are a lime lover you will probably enjoy this flavor, otherwise you might want to try one of the other varieties instead.  Personally I will finish up this batch but once they're gone I will go back to my habanero bbq and wasabi."
"These are the best snack food ever! Spicy AND healthy. The 100-calorie packs are a blessing 'cause I could gorge on them. The only drawback is they make your fingers messy, but that's a small price to pay."
"I originally found the big jar of these at Costco. They had them for about a minute and then they were gone. Thank goodness for Amazon, because I'm hooked on these almonds. If you like anything salt & vinegar, you'll love 'em! Now if Amazon could offer the large economy-size jar, all would be right with the world."
"I love these so much. If you like salt and vinegar chips and you like almonds, you will love these too. They're hard to find in the store but Amazon has you covered."
"I do like the Lime taste. It's pretty strong, and very unique. However, at no point in time did I feel like I was eating ""Lime and Chili"" almonds. There was absolutely no kick from the chili.Very tasty still, but not what I was hoping for."
These are my favorite flavored almonds!  Intense flavor!  I can't get enough lime.  Hard to find in the stores though sometimes.
"This wonderful combination of flavors proves to me that heaven truly exists. If you are a fan of Salt & Vinegar chips, you will LOVE these almonds! I've been through 2 cases of it and counting... shhhhhhhh!"
These are the best nuts ever and the value is best with the 6 pack.
"I don't need to say much more, these are good. Not really hot like you might assume given that it's jalapeno flavor. They just have a slight kick."
"Fantastic bold citrusy flavor.  Not very spicy, but quite savory.  Packet size is just right for a single serving snack."
Great way to purchase the Wasabi & Soy Almonds -- makes it easier to resist the temptation to eat too many!!
"VERY GOOD SERVICE, FABULOUS PRODUCT, VERY FRESH, EXTREMELY WELL PACKED.  WILL MOST DEFINITELY ORDER AGAIN."
Both the Bold Jalapeno and the Wasabi Soy almonds have taste great and make a good snack or party treat.
"I love these almonds - they are the perfect snack, you don't need to eat a lot to feel satisfied. Also, since they have a lot of flavor, you feel ""mouth-satisfied"" as well. The wasabi is not too hot (actually I wish it were just a little hotter) and the soy just adds a little bit of saltiness. I recommend these if you like wasabi peas but want something with more nutritional value."
"This is my favorite flavor but all the BOLD flavors are helping me stay on my low carb diet.  They taste great, crunchy, mouth full of flavor.  My whole office is now eating my ""diet food.""  If the sodium is high for your diet, mix them 50:50 with plain unsalted almonds. just YUMMY!"
Love the taste not to hot but a little tangy.  Price is good and really good service.
"I am on the Atkins diet, have been for four years, and almonds are an important part of snacking, these almonds are delicious. I have found blue diamond to be so fresh, and the salt and vinegar satisfy a multitude of cravings."
"Almonds are super nutritional food and while high in fat, are certainly better than cheese puffs!"
"These are very good.Like salt-and-vinegar potato chips, but more substantial and delicious. The almond gives a nice hint of sweetness under the assault of the vinegar. I've eaten 2/3rds a can at one sitting."
This was sent as a gift.  More than once I was told how happily they munched on these.  Always feel good to give a winner.
The Habanero BBQ are awesome. They are the perfect balance of sweet and heat. I eat them all day long.
I purchased these Blue Diamond Wasabi Almonds to try out for a snack and they are GREAT.  They are good as a snack between meals and they are quite filling.  My husband really loves the flavor of these Almonds.  I have already purchased another supply.  The price is so much less than at the grocery store and I get them right at my door step.
"To start I should say I HATE Almonds. I don't dislike them, I hate them (and I have tried all manner of almonds, from raw to various flavors). A former co-worker brought a huge jug of these to work and urged me to give one a try. Like the stubborn child who refuses to eat her veggies, I popped one in my mouth, with a large glass of water in hand to wash down what I expected to be the awful (to me) flavor. I was shocked to find I not only didn't object to these, but became hooked on them in short order.I have been unable to find this flavor in the mega jug my co-worked purchased at a big box retailer over a year ago and was pleased to find this option on Amazon for a price lower than my local grogery store. I wish that big jug were available, but these smaller cans probably assure a fresher product.I will add, that I am a big fan of vinegar, but am not a big fan of salt and vinegar chips. These almonds have an excellent balance of flavor."
"I got this wasabi soy flavor a few weeks ago. Tastes all right. But last week I got up out of bed and I was dizzy. I thought, ""hey that happens, no big deal..."" A few days ago I was running and I got really light headed. I thought, ""hey that happens, it's hot out..."" But yesterday I ate a few of these and I realized, ""hey these are really salty"" Now I don't know if all these things are related, but if there's one thing i'm sure of - it's that these are pretty salty."
"The Blue Diamond Lime Chili flavored almonds is the best flavor hands down.  Packages came sealed, and the almonds were fresh and delicious!  You should also try the Blazing Buffalo Wing and Habanero BBQ. The Wasabi and Soy were too salty for me though."
"These are awesome. And good for you to boot. Sure there's probably a little too much salt, but everything in moderation, right..."
"I love the lime and chili almonds from blue diamond and they are a great snack if you are on a low carb diet. In addition buying the 3-pack of 16oz bags at amazon is a great deal considering that the 6oz can usually costs $3.79 at my grocery store. At first I thought ""When am I ever going to finish 3x 16oz bags of almonds"" but that's no problem at all. I even have to trick myself and put just a few in a bowl so I won't eat half the bag on one evening. I am addicted to lime and chili almonds and I am O.K. with it. I hope you will enjoy them too."
Blue Diamond almonds are a huge favorite and I like trying all the flavors that they have.  These Habanero BBQ almonds are not spicy and actually have a sweet taste to it due to the bbq flavoring.  Would have liked them to be a bit hotter but taste pretty good as is!
I am so delighted to get these Salt and vinegar Almonds.  None of the stores near me carry them.  They are actually great for my diet.  I can eat as many as I like yet the amount has less calories than if I was eating chips.  I can only eat so many nuts at a time while I can pig out on chips and waste lots of calories. My friends are always digging in my closet to see if I have any when they visit.  Love them.mls
"We discovered these Blue Diamond almond snacks while on vacation a couple of months ago.  We loved them!  Our favorites are the Lime and Chili as well as the Salt and Vinegar.  They are very tasty as well as healthy.  When we got home, we purchased them from Amazon.  We bought the 1.5 ounce snack bags.  They are perfect for lunches or travel snacks.  They also help with portion control!By purchasing them in bulk from Amazon, we are able to get them for $1 or less per bag.  When we purchased them from a convenience store on our vacation we paid $2+ per bag.  It's a great savings to buy them here."
My whole family loves these almonds. We're buying a pack of 12 about once a month. Great price (even cheaper than what we've been able to find at the grocery store). Great quality. Healthier than salt & vinegar chips :) Wish Amazon had this item as a Subscribe and Save!!
"The Bold Habanero BBQ flavor is amazing!!!  Plain almonds are very tasteless and hard to eat.  However, they are such a powerful and healthy food, I work them into my diet several days a week.  With flavors like this, it makes it very easy to do so.  The price you pay for these on Amazon is second to none!"
I absolutely love the new bold Salt & Vinegar almonds by Blue Diamond! It just doesn't get any better than this!
"A great flavor and 4g net carbs, 2g sugars. Nearly guilt-free snacking and an awesome amount of fat. These aren't the ideal nut for low-carb and/or keto diets, macadamias are probably closer, but these are much more widely available and the flavors make it easier to snack reasonably."
These Soy & Wasabi almonds from Blue Diamond are my absolute favorite - just enough kick & the almonds tide you over until mealtime. The resealable bag keeps them nice & fresh.  Love them!!
"I love all these different flavors that they have come out with for Blue Diamond almonds.  Soooo Goood.  While this one wasn't as good as the Wasabi flavor, it was still delicious."
First tried these at my work vending started buying them everyday $1.25 per 2ozs. (WOW)  Went o Amazon and saw I could get them cheaper so I order 6 bags took them on vacation with me my family loved them all of them wanted to know where to buy them they are just diffrent and that little warm bang surprise is good.  Will contiue to but these.  Good flavor and good price for the larger bag!
These almonds just have a great flavor.  Just the right amount of heat.  It's hard to stop eating them.  Good thing my wife is here to stop me.
These are a delicious and healthy snack when eaten in moderation. The flavor is great and isn't too over powering at all. The wasabi flavor is strong and feels like it's going to be hot but the heat never really shows up.
"The taste of these almonds are addictive.  They are spicy, but not too hot like you'd think a habanero would be.  It's been hard to stay out of them and I eat too many in a day.  The price from this seller is stellar and about the same price (per lb) that I find at walmart for a small can.We will re-order soon as the almonds are almost gone  :-)"
"I love all of the Blue Diamond Almond flavors and they are my favorite snack.  This one while good was not great for me.  When I hear the word ""Bold"" I expect something over the top and this one was just sort of medium.  It seems that they aimed for the middle of the road when it comes to being a spicy flavor!  We have Buffalo Wing restaurants here that offer about 6 grades of spiciness from hot to death and this wasn't even close.If I compare this to the Blue Diamond Wasabi & Soy spiciness it is not even in the same galaxy.  This is still a good flavor but not what I was expecting.One serving of these nuts is 170 Calories and it contains 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of carbohydrates, 3 grams of fiber and only 1 gram of sugar and 1 gram of saturated fat. You also get calcium, vitamin E and magnesium from the almonds which are good for your body, heart and bones. I would rather eat 28 of these almonds for 170 calories than 11 potato chips for the same calories and none of the dietary benefits.This flavor does have 9% of your daily intake of sodium which is almost twice the amount in many of the other Blue Diamond flavors. It has even 50% more salt than the Bold Salt `n Vinegar flavor? For that reason I will eat this flavor more sparingly.The only problem with these almonds is that they taste so good you have to be able to close the can and walk away. If you don't like the super bold and spicy flavors then this flavor is ideal for you, just watch the salt.I like all of the Blue Diamond Almond products as I feel that they are healthier for you as long as you don't overdo it in eating them. Since they have a more moderate flavor than what I was expecting for a ""Bold"" product and contain so much salt I gave it 4 stars.  I eat these almonds because they taste good and are healthier for you but the extra salt in this one negates some of the health benefits in my opinion. This is still a good flavor and I like them but not love them!"
"These are delicious. I will buy them again and again. They are not for everyone, but if you like wasabi peas, you will love these. The flavoring works great with the taste of almonds."
Both of my medium-large dogs love this chew. The only downside is that the chew doesn't last them more than a couple hours (they devour the large ones right away) and the chicken strip leaves a red stain wherever they laid down to eat.
"Like others have said, it only lasts a few hours, but I love that my dog loves it. She is abouy 75 lbs and is a very avid chewer. This is one of the only bones I know I can buy that wont go to waste.It really does help the stinky mouth and gum health."
"Having remembered Red Velvet cake from the south as a child, I found this cake mix to be excellent and it has received rave reviews from adults and kids alike.  Rich like chocolate, but lighter - this is a solid favorite of all who try it for the first time. The color is enticing to some, scary to others, but once tasted - with a cream cheese frosting - all are fans.  Easy to make, perfect every time!"
"For those of you not familiar with the great Urban Legend of the Red Velvet Cake recipe that cost $240 dollars, see Jan Harold Brunvand's series of books on Urban Legends starting with THE VANISHING HITCHIKER available here on Amazon. Most of us know the legend in it's more modern form as the ""Mrs. Field's Chocolate Chip cookie recipe"" that some poor unsuspecting soul requested and was told would cost ""Two-forty"" and who assumed that meant Two Dollars and forty cents only to receive a credit card bill of $240. Needless to say the legend is NOT true, never WAS true & never will be true be it about the cookies, Red Velvet Cake or Waldorf Salad( Another part of the legend).Red Velvet Cake started out as a pretty and regional variant of Devil's Food cake and is really just a wonderfully light chocolate cake with red colouring added to it. It is often topped with either a vanilla buttercream frosting or in more modern times with cream cheese frosting. The Duncan Hines mix is probably a better option than any of the current recipes floating around that are often remnents of the old Urband Legend for a variety of reasons. Many of the legendary recipes have bizarre added ingredients intended to make the recipe look weird or authentic and often call for far more food coloring than is needed, imparting a bitter flavor and ghastly colour to the finished cake.Having had the Duncan Hines mix as a child and again more recently, I can attest to its superiority over most of the existing recipes for Red Velvet Cake. The Duncan Hines Cake Mix has a lovely chocolate flavor and just the right amount of red color to make the final product interesting. When made as a layer cake (preferabley with four thin layers as opposed to two thick ones) and topped with Cream cheese icing, the Duncan Hines Red Velvet Cake makes a wonderfully festive Holiday cake sure to provoke conversation. You may find yourself having to give away a number of the boxes of mix you now have to friends eager to make it themselves and share the intriguing legend. The finished cake truly is a show-stopper!Conventional wisdom is that the cake itself began as a Southern tradition and indeed, it can still be found on the dessert menus of some venerable Southern eateries. The best I ever had was in Nashville at an old Inn but it wasn't all that superior to the Duncan Hines mix which is more moist and lighter in texture than most Tradtional ( as opposed to ""legendary"" ) recipes.You can still find elaborate versions of Red Velvet cake popping up in places such as the Swiss Colony Holiday Catalog but for outragious prices. Do what I do and make your own! Since it is near impossible to find anywhere else, go ahead and order the mix here. Even if you only make it a few times a year, the mix lasts a long time and is a good value when you consider its ""Star Quality"" as a dessert and a natural conversation piece! I know of one mom whose daughter got an 'A' when using the cake as a demonstration of modern Folklore in her high-school social studies class!If all that info isn't enough inducement to try it...just remember..it's chocolate cake for heaven's sake! And...it's pretty! What more could a person want?"
"I was looking all over for a simple recipe for RV Cupcakes and kept finding different variations with so-so reviews.  I had given up and decided to add tons of red food coloring to a basic cake mix when I ran across this in our local grocery store.  It worked perfectly, and we ended up with tasty, beautiful, classic Red Velvet Cupcakes.  Fun!"
"I have had this cake with both the cream cheese and white frosting.  For a real treat try frosting with a white chocolate frosting then call your heart surgeon (but what a way to go!):White Chocolate FrostingIngredients:6ounces White Chocolate -- chopped1/4 cup Whipping Cream1 cup Butter -- Cut In Pieces1 cup Powdered SugarDon't forget to add a dash of salt!Directions:Microwave white chocolate and cream in medium bowl on high for 1 1/2 minutes until chocolate is almost melted, stirring halfway through heating time. Stir until white chocolate is completely melted. Cool to room temperature. Beat butter and sugar gradually into cooled mixture on high speed until light and fluffy."
This is one of the best cake mixes ever. Everyone thought that I had made it from scratch.
I used three boxes of the red velvet cake mix for a company gathering recently and the cake was a hit at the party! People kept coming up to me saying how they loved that the cake was so moist. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who needs to make a red velvet cake for someone in short period of time.
"Wow!  I couldn't believe I just made the BEST Red Velvet cake ever!  I love to bake but normally avoid cake mix from a box (sugar control) but store keeps putting these things on shelf for 99 cents so I couldn't resist.  (Good for a lazy day for bake for friends/family)I tried (followed instruction exactly) Duncan Strawberry Cake mix before and hated it.  I gave Red Velvet a try with a little adaptation.  Instead of 1/3 cup of oil as instructed on the box, I used 1/3 cup of applesauce and a dash (1/2 tsp) of oil.  Preparation was a breeze and couldn't get easier than 'mix everything in a bowl on low' and bake.  I felt like working out so I manually used a wisk and mixed it away with my power hand! :)I baked it according to the instruction and the cake came out gorgeous!  Very dark red color, puffy, moist and DELICIOUS!  It's so good I didn't even mind the extra sweetness!  I also frost it with cream cheese frosting for my DH. (Mr. Sweet tooth)Creamcheese: 1 (8oz) soften cream cheese, 1 stick soften butter, 1 1/2 cup powder sugar, 1 tsp vanila, dashes of salt.  BEAT away for 10 minutes and it will come out just like what you lick off a Cinnabon!"
very good product! very moist & delicious. a very enjoyable cake. being a canadian i've never experienced anything like this before. shipping was a liitle expensive but overall the taste of the cake was well worth it. give it a try.. very highly recommend it.
this was the only way i could get this cake because every store here does not sell it any more.  so had to get it here shipping and handeling was alot more then the product. never again.....
"Loved the cake mix. It is very hard to find the red velvet in stores, so i had no choice but to order it online. I really wanted it, and i guess you get what you pay for- but i did think the shipping cost was way too high in comparison to the cost of the Mix. End the end, 2 boxes of cake mix which was about 6.00 with shipping (12.00) ended up costing me like 17.00! I don't think I would ever order it again with that shipping cost unless it was for a special occasion. But i must say that they did deliver in a timely fashion."
"These cookies are so so good.  We buy them at Hy-Vee and Costco.  I love when we go to Costco because they have the big bag.  When ordering, be sure to buy more than one bag.  Seriously, you will be sad when the bag is gone."
"I love these little cookies I discovered during a sampling at Whole Foods. While I can buy them locally, I appreciate being to send them to my elderly mother in California. She also loves these cookies and won't even share them!"
These are so &*^^&%%^ good!! hahahahah - They taste buttery and brown-sugary.  I just love them.  What a great purchase i made.  I will order again!
"The product was very good, and the service I received was quick and very much appreciated."
I ordered 10 packages and they didn't last long. Delicious!!Excellent Customer Service! Quick Ship! Well boxed.Thank you for offering on-line.  I will order more in future.  = )
These little unassuming cookies are great. All natural ingredients and great taste. I have been hooked on these for about a year. I will need to get some more soon. Try them you will like them too....
"I'm not a big fan of sunflower seeds, but I love these cookies. Sweet, hearty, and slightly salty, they're unlike any other cookie I've tasted. I'm so excited to have found them online; I haven't been able to find them anywhere else since moving away from Kansas."
"Received my first package as a gift, and could not wait to share them with friends. I cannot say enough about the service provided by the seller, Sparkle Auto.  Their exceptional attention to packaging these cookies for shipment guarantees they will arrive in ""mint"" condition!"
These are the best cookies. I am not a big cookie lover but these are great.
"These little cookies are the best ever.  Who can stop at just a handful.  I found them at our local HY-Vee store in the organic section.  We all know that sunflower seeds are important to our health, but to have them in such a decedant form is just well wonderful. Amazon is selling these cookies cheaper than in the stores so stock up and have fun with them.  They never seem to last very long at my home."
"Yes, the cookies are wonderful, but $8.99 for a 12-ounce bag? I get them for $4.59 at my small independent natural food store. And I'm not in a low cost shipping area.If these cookies were $6 they would rank in the top 10,000 at Amazon. Sell them for $5 and they could get to 5,000. Everybody likes to make a buck, but I think they are being a little ambitious at $9 a bag.I give the cookies 6 stars, but take away 3 for vendor greed."
I bought these at my local Natural Grocer and they were delicious!  It was all I could do not to sit down and eat the entire bag.  They are buttery and the sunflower seeds add the perfect crunch.
"I just want to say, that these cookies are delicious!  They are the best!!! Grace's Best Sunflower seed cookies are a very appropriate name!Candace from Rochester NY"
These cookies are delicious but most assuredly NOT worth $8.99. Shame on Amazon for charging this much!!!! Amazing that Amazon has the audacity to charge this much. I have bought these cookies at Whole Foods for $4.99 and at Natural Grocers/Vitamin Cottage for $4.69.  I thought THESE PRICES were too much...I was shocked when I saw them priced even higher on Amazon.  Grace's has their own website but they charge more than Whole Foods.  Since when did we have to dole out this much money to get a good cookie???  My mother used to make cookies this good - now I just need to find the right recipe to replace the need to purchase these too expensive cookies.  I would rather do without and send the money to some needy family.  Seems that Amazon would rather rip off the consumer and keep the extra for themselves.
"I found these cookies at Hy-Vee grocery store (midwest) and they are fantastic!  They run $3 & change but worth every penny. Can't believe they're all natural ingredients, no crap on this label and it shows in the taste.  The only thing you won't like about these cookies is they are hard to put down."
"If you like small snack cookies that you know are made with all natural ingredients, then this is your cookie. They did arrive fresh and I really liked them. However, my sons (5 and 3) did not. I think the taste is a little more sophisticated than they like. But I really liked them and so did my husband."
"I've been eating these cookies since they were a family favorite right out of the kitchen. Named for my cousin Grace, her grandmother came up with this recipe years ago and they have been addictive ever since! You won't be able to stop eating them. They are fabulous!"
"We have them at the local HyVee in Independence, MO for $3.89 for the 12 oz bag.  I tasted them for the first time last week and man I am in love!!!  I am already on my second bag.  I hope I can exercise and cut down on other things to keep healthy."
"Wow!  I was shocked to find these on Amazon.  We get them from our local high-end food market in Chicago three bags at a time - at least!  We're about to move, and couldn't imagine life without them, so I searched online to find out where they are sold in our new hometown - never imagined they'd be here on Amazon.  They are so fantastic - and good for you.  But beware, they are incredibly additive!"
"The price for 12 oz of these cookies is absurd. They are good, but not worth the money. Buy them at Costco (24 oz bags) for less!!"
"The vanilla flavor tastes fine, unlike the fake tasting flavors like lemon. I believe it's best to get plain vanilla pudding and add flavor. For example, adding 1/2 cup of pumpkin makes great pumpkin pudding and a heaping tablespoon of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001VNFHLC"">Frontier Cocoa Powder, Dutch-process Certified Organic, Fair Trade Certified, 16-Ounce Bag</a> makes better chocolate pudding than either the Jello chocolate or fudge flavors in my opinion. I also like to add wheat germ to the pudding to lessen the bitter taste of wheat germ and make the pudding more nutritious."
"These nuts are amazing, just the right amount of salty and the nuts are huge! Very addicting, want to eat the whole bag."
"These are supposed to be lightly salted, but in fact the salt is very heavy and clings tightly to the nuts, making it almost impossible to wipe off the excess. Even worse, many of the nuts, especially the smaller ones, are soft and chewy rather than crunchy, possibly rancid? There are a lot of incredibly tiny nuts in the bag, like I have never seen before. I certainly won't order these again!"
"THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD BUT IT HAS BEEN A WHILE SINCE I'VE HAD MACADAMIA NUTS SO NEED TO TRY ANOTHER BRAND TO TRUELY COMPARE. I FIND SOME IN THE BAG THAT ARE REALLY DARK AND UPON EATING THEM ARE GUMMY AND CHEWEY. THIS I DON'T LIKE CONSIDERING THE PRICE. THEY NEED TO CHECK AND BE MORE THOROUGH IN THEIR ROASTING PROCESS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ORGANIC THING. NEED TO ROAST IN SMALLER BATCHES! OKAY! THAT'S IT FOR ME. THESE SHOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER. I DON'T DRINK COFFEE SO I HAVEN'T TRIED THEIR BRAND. BESIDES, COFFEE I'SNT GOOD FOR YOU COFFEE CONNOSIEURS!!!!!!!  WILL UPDATE SOMEDAY. GOOD BYE & THANKS"
"Great product and shipped quickly! I bought it as a present and they loved it. Thanks a lot, I will be buying again in the future!"
These are the best crackers on the market!  Taste delicious with some natural peanut butter and apple slices.  They are $5.99 per box at the local grocery so Amazon's price is tempting.  I find that when I am cutting back to lose a few pounds one of these crackers is very filling and healthy and can curb cravings for sugary snacks.
"These crackers are just fantastic. I do not have any kinds of problems with wheat (for those of you who do, you should try any of the other Doctor Kracker flatbreads - they are made with spelt flour.)These do contain wheat, and they are incredibly crunchy and satisfying. In fact these may be the crunchiest crackers I've ever had - and that is a big plus for me.  They are sweet (naturally - from the whole grains) and filling and are very healthy for you. They are good with any kind of topping (peanut butter or fruit) but I usually just pop them in my mouth as is.Highly highly recommended.*I have tried the other Doctor Kracker flatbreads - the ones with spelt flour instead of wheat - and I don't much care for them. In my opinion these are the best."
"I have ordered many perishable items from Amazon over the years and have usually had no problems.  I received crackers yesterday and went to open them today.  Happened to glance at the bottom and crackers had expired on OCTOBER 6, 2011.  Three MONTHS ago!  This is totally not cool."
The price is 2x's as expensive than other merchants on-line. You can even get these at Walmart for $3.99 and thats less than 50% of what this merchant is charging.
"These are a great cracker - wholesome with great crunch from all the seeds. Have even had this as a quick meal - with a little cheese or peanut butter - add a salad and it is very satisfying. The ingredients are all simple, organic and nutritious. They weren't available for a while and we were worried they were out of business. We will often take one along for a midday snack."
"I don't think any description can prepare you for how crunchy these crackers are... Even I, a cracker addict and lover of crunchiness, was shocked at how hard and crunchy they were. Of course by the time I finished the box I was used to it and now all other crackers seem too soft! The taste is awesome, with generous amounts of seeds, which I love. I think with the amount of seeds included, this is a healthy snack. I have had them on their own and with cheese and they taste great either way."
"These crackers are like crack. I can't get enough. Originally I found a box of these at a Marshalls and picked one because I was hungry. When I tried to get another box of these, Marshalls didn't carry them anymore so I Googled them and now order them online. I normally buy all of my food at my local grocery store and this is the first and only time I have ever ordered a food product online. These go great with salads"
"Very very satisfying , crunchy and good. Difficult to eat just oneVery very satisfying , crunchy and good. Difficult to eat just one"
"These crackers are fantastic in flavor and crunchiness!  They are nutritiously healthy and low in sodium.  My grandson and my sister love them too.  I have them on auto-delivery monthly from Amazon. Dr. Kracker also makes a variety of other flavors. The only problem I have is that Amazon has increased the price gradually from when I first started ordering them in September 2010 at $14.89 ($2.48 per box) for a case of 6 boxes, to $25.73 in March 2011 ($4.29 per box).  That is a price increase of $10.84 (or 72%) for the same case of 6 boxes of crackers.  I think that is an outrageous price increase!  Amazon has made them very expensive but I do like the convenience of having them delivered to me monthly and I always use up the six boxes before the next delivery.  If I weren't an elderly person that uses a wheelchair to shop, I would instead buy them at Whole Foods, where they cost less than this."
"These are great hearty , organic crackers. I highly recommend them but they are not for the week of teeth. They are thick and need a good strong bite to eat. Great taste and topped with a wonderful seed mixture. This is my second time purchasing them. Great quality and much better price here than in the store."
"These are wonderful crackers.  High protein and no sugar.  However, the shipper sent them too close to the expiration date, so tasted a little off."
"Just a short time ago I bought a box of Doctor Kracker crispbreads and they were so good I just had to come back and try another variety. This time I chose the Klassic 3 seed. Wow! These are really, really good  crispbreads, the best I've ever had. I had this one topped with shredded crabmeat and a little dab of cocktail sauce. Nice combination. I'm sure the crispbreads will go with all sorts of other  things. They're real fresh and crunchy and just delicious. I wonder how many varieties they make?Gary Peterson"
"I ordered these after having crackers at Jason's Deli by the same manufacturer. However, I did not like them as well as the ones from the restaurant. I found out that those are made especially for Jason's and not available from Dr. Kracker, the manufacturer. Bummer... Still good crackers tho...aj"
"I adore these crunchy crackers. They are so full of good things and are completely guilt free. Organic, nutty, healthy, hearty. These are made even better when sprinkled with a dash of salt. My only complaint is that they are a little hard to find."
"OK, this is just one of my favorite foods of all time. I eat these with a slice of cheddar or laughing cow spreadable cheese. YUM! I think the price of these is a bit high, but if you sign up for ""subscribe and save"" you get a decent little discount. I wish they would package these with a variety of flavors (instead of 6 all the same). I like the other ones, too, but don't want to spend $100 on CRACKERS to get all the flavors!"
These crackers are so seedy and nutty!  They are wonderful with tuna and my kids LOVE them even plain! Great product and great price!
These crackers are delicious and filling. I have given up bread and these are a healthy substitute. I would recommend them to anyone.
"This cracker is crunchy, flavorful and has the body to stand on it's own.It is a great accompaniement with nut butters, cheese or hummus.Enjoy it for breakfast, lunch, or snack. Doctor Kracker is my favorite go-to treat!"
"Most olive oils taste the same to me.  The differences are subtle but overall the flavor is mild.I always enjoyed a well flavored olive oil in which to dip a nice piece of bread.  Ravika is the only olive oil I have found which, straight out of the bottle, is wonderful for dipping bread.It adds a lot to pasta and any dish where you want to taste the oil.Try adding a little to cooked rice and then mixing it with some cooked frozen vegetables like peas or corn."
"I feed my two Pugs and occasional rescue Newman's Advanced Dog formula. I like this better than the regular Newman's, because it has less ingredients. I supplement with high quality can food, organic free range chicken, healthy powder and salmon oil. My boys are healthy; their coats are amazing. Highly recommend but with supplements--see above."
"Newman products have been used in our home for years. After researching Newman's Adult Dog food I felt confident in giving the food to our two cocapoo's. They love it! One of them wolfs it down in 4 seconds! Really, I timed it.With so many companies recalling dog foods,I felt the Newman company being organic would be more reliable. Keeps me from worrying so much as I pour that bowl of food for them."
This food is great. My 11 year old beagle loves it and she is much more active since I changed her food. I highly recommend this dog food.
We have had trouble in finding dog food for one of our small dogs who obviously has a very sensitive stomach.  We have tried several kinds of dog food for her and Newman's Own Organic seems to be agreeing with her. So we will continue purchasing this product through Amazon as long as it does.
"Love the fact that it is on Subscribeand save.  The change to this food has had many benefits. My dog loves it, has aided in the suppression of tear staining (he's part beagle, part King Charles), and makes his poo firm."
"I was using Organix for a while, and was happy with the ingredients, and my dog seemed to enjoy it. Then I saw all the great reviews for Newman's Own Organic Dog Food, along with the great price, and decided to give it a try.They say that it takes a dog a while to get used to a new food, but I have to tell you: from the first day I gave him the Newman's Own, he REFUSED to eat the Organix anymore, he loved the Newman's Own so much - even though he'd eaten the Organix for years! I even tried mixing the bit of Organix I had left in with the Newman's Own. But he would just pick out the pieces and leave them on the floor next to his bowl.So, I don't know what it is, but my dog sure seems to love this food! He's eating more now and he's very healthy.Again, I had no complaints about the Organix. I think it's probably a good dog food. But my dog sure prefers the Newman's Own!!"
"I have a 11 yr old Pomimo (1/2 Pomeranian, 1/2 American Eskimo) who seems to only like human food. Although I'd love to give him human food all the time, I know it's not good for his digestive system, and it doesn't have the proper nutrients required for a dog, especially at his current age. Upon trying various brands including Blue and Call of the Wild, I couldn't justify the price in comparison to how little my dog liked the taste. After reading some positive reviews here on Amazon for Newman's, I decided to give it a go. Surprisingly, my dog started eating the food immediately after I poured some into his dish. He never does that with other dry dog food, and usually waits to eat after I've given him a nibble of everything that I eat during the day. What makes it even better is the reasonable price for the quality. Yes, I understand that organic and quality US-made food are naturally more expensive, however some of the brands charge double of Newman's and provide only half the taste. As humans, we're usually sold by the nutritious & wholesome advertisements when buying dog food, however I think its pretty important for my dog to actually like the taste of the food also. Newman's seems to be the ticket for both nutrition and taste. Will be buying Newman's as a regular!"
We have been feeding our dog Newman's Own since she was very young.  She was a finiky eater and I was a determined owner who insisted on organic food.  Both of our needs were fulfilled when we found this great product.  It's the only dog food that she has eaten and she is going to be 9 years old next month.  The only reason she ever has gone to the vet is for her shots.  I highly recommend this food....I am SOOO glad amazon carries it now because we had to drive quite a distance to buy it before at a organic pet shop.....
I'm very pleased with this dog food.  Haven't ordered anything else for my dogs since I bought this.  My lab and my malti poo both eat it happily and I'm happy that it is healthy for them.
"I highly recommend Newman's Own Organics Dog Food. Natural, high is nutrition and with out fillers. Keep your dogs healthy and with lots of energy for a long time!"
It took for a week to waiting them to ship for the item but soooo pleased to myself and my dog :-) Thank you for the Newman's daughter to keeping an awesome company n' caring our pets!!!! 5 stars!
"I switched my dog to this food and watching him truly enjoy eating and the taste of his food is worth anything.  He has eaten Precise foundation formula for the almost two years since I adopted him.  He often goes off his food and/or vomits from time to time.  I've tried switching him to Wellness and Blue Buffalo with no positive results.  I can't tell you the immediate difference in him from the first time he ate the Newman's...and he looks forward to every meal, doesn't beg for other stuff because he is satisfied, and he seems to have more energy.  He is a 110-lb Great Pyrenees and finally very happy with his food."
"We have two Westies who, to say the least, have very sensitive digestion systems.  Since using this product, their hair is soft and moisturized, they love their food, and to boot, they are down to their recommended weight. We're on the automatic delivery program and that's the best no brainer ever."
"The ingredients are really wholesome. And, fast delivery!It would be nice if they had some type of fish formula though.But my dog loves them and will buy again!"
"We switched to this brand because one of our dog's eyes always teared, and someone said it could be from a corn allergy.  This is one of only a few brands that is corn free and it cured the teary eye problem quickly.  BLUE brand does not contain corn, but they include garlic in their blend which can cause kidney problems in dogs over time according the veteriniarian.  It smells more natural than Purina One which I had been feeding them and they seem to like it better.  I like that the sales from the food go to charity too.  A good product."
We've originally bought this as our dog's first food and then switched to Wellness. Dog had runs for a few weeks hoping it would go away then went back to Newman's own and now our dog feels a lot better. Never switched his food ever again.
"My dogs love this food! No allergies, more energy and nicer coats. My big dogs skin doesn't seem nearly as irritated and I am assuming with a little more use his skin will be normal again. We like it m2 ofore than any other I have seen. My only problem is that I have 2 dogs one huge one and 12.5lbs hardly make it a month. We really could use bigger bags or a qty discount. Plus I cannot find this in any stores so when I ran out I had to by a substitute...UPDATE: My second shipment did not arrive at all. i have been trying to contact buyer but I cannot figure it out... Had to go back to the old food at least I realize that this food did not help with the dry itchy skin that the dogs have.. :{"
This brand is the lowest price I can find in organic dog kibbles. The subscription is convenient. I wish the company makes 50 pound bags.
"We have been using this product for over a year now, Goldie our dog loves it, she is 15 years old now."
"Good but not my favorite.........Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 7-Pound Bag....I now buy my dogs Taste of the Wild Salmon just great stuff buy it on Amazon!~ The less fillers the better not meals for my doggies!~"
I have two English bull terrier with bad allergies. One of which is very picky and quickly stopped eating any type of dog food that I bought. They have been eating Newman's advanced dog formula for active or senior dogs for 18 months now and have not tired of it. Their skin and mobility has improved and they love it. I buy it by subscription so we never have to worry about running out and it is the cheaper way to purchase. My local stores only sell small bags which is an expensive way to buy.
"Received in a timely manner and in good condition. My Mishka is a little spoiled (I cook her meals when I can afford it, buy her wellness kibble when I can't) but she ate this willingly. I bought this because it qualified for overnight shipping, unlike the much heavier wellness bag, and she was almost out of kibble. I'm happy with the compromise."
"I buy Newmans Own adult dog food for my two chihuahuas.  I've always fed them natural, human-grade dog food, even though most brands can be a bit pricey.  Like most pet parents, I try to do the best I can for my dogs which starts with feeding them right.  Most dog food can be disgusting and the practices behind it are disturbing.  Newmans Own is more affordable, and I feel good about the company's ethics and practices so it was worth a try.My dogs love it so it was easy to switch from the other brand.  They gobble it up! I now have it on subscription so we don't run out."
"4-year old Elkhound loves this food, and it keeps her in great health.  Amazon has the best price I've found for this food, and it's even better with subscribe and save.  I highly recommend it."
"Great alternative to dog food with corn and other by-products. Our picky dogs enjoy this food and so do I, knowingit is better their health."
I feel good about the quality and mix it with canned PN food.  She doesn't care for it by itself but then she doesn't like any dry dogfood.
"One of the best for our 11 year old Jack Russell mix.I always check to make the first ingredient is meat or chicken, not a byproduct."
I have 4 adult Shih-Tzus and while they do prefer it when I cook for them...... they do eat this and it has helped eliminate the brownish tear stains they get when I feed them some dry foods.
"I've been searching for a no-corn natural dog food to keep skin rashes away...tried Halo which was great but so expensive.  This is a little more affordable and the ingredient list looks very similar to Halo, but....oh boy.  I'm just glad it's warm enough to have the windows open!  My dog loves the taste and the quality seems great, so we'll try 2 more days to see if things settle down."
"I read all the reviews before buying this food and overall I was impressed with the product myself.  The dogs like it, they have no ill effects as 1 reviewer alleged (looking at her other reviews I think hers should be tossed by Amazon) and I can get it for even less on a subscription with Prime which means 2 Day No Cost shipping.  Whats not to love?  I do mix this with some Prescription Diet J/D since I have one ""older' dog and 1 with some allergies and the combo seems to help.  Bottom Line:  It is a good product and after doing a ton of reading (I don't buy my animals cheap food or ANYTHING that I think comes from China) I think it does everything it claims."
"My YorkiePoo thrives on this dog food.  I ran out two weeks ago, no local source, bought a competitor's so called equivalent only to see my Quinn suffer from itching and belly aches.  I ordered this from Amazon yesterday, free shipping, they sent it out hours later and I recieved it today!"
"My Tibetin Terrior is 3 years old and has been on Wellness food since birth.  I just recently found Newman's Own Organics.The price was a bit cheaper, plus free shipping to my home!  AWESOME!  When I started to gradually change foods.  My LIVI,would eat only the Newmans' and leave the Wellness to later when she was really hungry.  So Funny!  She is the ""queen"" and she knows it!!"
"I don't know why, because it doesn't look very appetizing, but my two dachshunds love this stuff and scarf it down with great abandon."
I have been using the product for several months now.  The dogs seem to like it and having it delivered is really nice.  What more can I say?
"Hello, I have tried some different foods for my dog,but this is the one she tolerates the best.I have a 13 year old Border Collie/Lab mix and have been giving her this food for quite some time now.She loves it.Thank you."
"the auto ship is a terrific way to get hard to find dog food like Newman's-- I can;t find it in my area at all, and it is all my elderly dog can eat with her IBS and preservative sensitivities.  Easy and cost effective.  I only wrestle with the CO2 footprint on having it to be shipped :((  And am working on finding an offset for that. !! :)"
I feed my 10 year old toy breed this food and she hasn't complained yet.  Was feeding her Eukanuba her whole life before the dog food scare.  Switched then to only organic brands like Wellness.  This product has been the best deal on organic dog food I have found and with the subscribe and save...perfect!!
"This is a great product. Very comforting for owners that it is all natural (and mostly organic) with no by products and preservatives.We gave our dog (a 7 year old lab mix) PetPromise before. After the transition it took a couple of days for her to get used to it, but once she did she loves it. My dog is quite picky about her food and she likes ""junk food"" better rather than wholesome food and treats (of course!). She is very used to Newman's own now and it gives her very good bowl movement. Always a plus!"
"I adopted a rescue dog who had an allergy to corn. I checked every bag in local stores but all main fillers were corn. I thought I would have to drive to nearest pet store (120 mile round trip)to find a corn free dog food. Then I found this brand on Amazon which listed all the ingretents. No corn! My dog loves it so much, I even use it as a trick when training her. I'll be buying again and again."
"My dog never met a meal she didn't love including this one.  The price is very good, especially utilizing the subscription option.  I make 2/3 of the food I feed my dog, it's very easy and economical and the best way to control the quality."
very high quality food that my dog will actually eat .. always ships promptly and well packaged
"I've always given my dog what I thought was high quality dog food since she was a puppy.  After the pet food issues of a few years ago I switched to only organic dog food for her.  Since she is only 10 lbs the price difference isn't too bad.  I am a free feeder which isn't ideal but means my dog basically has access to food any time she wants it.  Because of this she only gets really excited when ""people"" food is offered to her.  Well when I open this bag she comes over and eats asap.  Good enough for me!"
"This food might have great contents, but my 7 1/2 lb, 11/2 yr old poodle doesn't like the taste. She's not a picky eater."
"Yayy!!! Not feeling well today and dreading having to go to grocery store. But the one thing I cannot do without is dog food. (love my dogs). Low and behold, the door bell rang and it was like Santa heard me. I can't believe how quickly my order came. I was so happy I posted on facebook, and text to my mother. Thank you AMAZON :-) Thank you PRIME!!!"
Based on the great reviews from everyone about their picky dogs loving it and always eating it I figured my picky dog would enjoy it as well.  The price for the amount is also very good considering it is all organic but sadly my dog hates it..  She smells it and walks away and when i try to hide the food she finds her way to eat around this food.  I wont be buying it again but I really wished my dog enjoyed it so I could continue to support this brand.
"I tried many different types of dry food for my picky eater, a cavalier king charles spaniel. When I found the Newmans own I hit gold. My dog loves it, he licks his bowl clean, and best of all it is good for him. His coat looks very healthy and his intermittent stomach issues are controlled. I am really happy with this brand. I wish it was available at more stores."
"I have started buying a lot of organic food over the past year, and it dawned on me that perhaps my dog should be eating more healthfully also. When I look at the list of ingredients on regular dog food, it is downright nauseating! I bought some of this Newman's Own and my dog loves it. She usually gobbles it up the minute I put it into the bowl."
"I expected Newman's Own dog food to be great.  It may be very nutritious, but my little terriers told me, ""We are NOT eating this stuff.  Period.  No Way.""  After 3 days they sniffed their bowls and walked away.  So I ordered another organic dog food (Natural Balance Organics) and it came today.  So, half old, half new, by the book, and they picked out the new stuff and left the Newman's in the bowl.  Go figure.  Just thought some of you might like to know.  I am switching them from Iams to something much healthier and I finally think I have a match.  But it's not Newman's."
This large bag of dry pet food is highly recommended for you adult dog. It's also worth purchasing this larger sized bag (or get two of them at once) in order to stock up on this food for a greater length of time.
"My dogs love it, even the little princess terrier.  I've tried many other brands and they enjoy this one the most as so far."
Fast Delivery.  Product arrived exactly as described.  Would purchase again from this company.
"I believe that dog food should be what your dog likes to start with.Next, I think that you should do research to make sure it is right foryour pooch!!! All human grade products go into the dog food, anotherdecision is the size, and for 14 lbs. a 7 pound bag is perfect!!! Buyingat Amazon is a great way to buy, because they have the 7 pounder!!!"
"If you are looking for an actual organic dog food, Newman's Own is not the way to go. I accidently purchased this thinking it was what it claimed on the front package, only to read the ingredient list to find out that basically everything else but the chicken was organic. With all of the drugs and hormones fed to conventionally raised ""food animals"" this ingredient is the most important one that should be organic."
"I cringed a little after reading the ingredient list. Way too much grains and not enough quality protein for our dogs. Notice all of them are at the beginning, which means they make up quite a bit of the diet. Soy protein is included but some dogs don't do well with soy (mine) and meat should be the protein source in dog food, not grains.Not recommended for your furry ones."
"I rotate between Newmans, Nature Balance, and Ceasar Milans organic dog food. My dog eat's all three so can't say which is better. My main reason to purchase this brand (or any Newman product) is for the charity the profits goes to. My way of supporting companies that give back."
"I signed up for the monthly subscription for this item. The price is great especially without having to pay shipping charges. I love the fact that I can manage the subscription by skipping a month or ordering it earlier than scheduled. Amazon has been excellent getting my shipments out on a timely manner. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000VK33C6"">Newman's OwnÂ® Organics Adult Dog Food Chicken & Rice Formula, 7-Pound Bag</a>Very pleased with all my orders from Amazon. Extremely pleased with their customer service! THANKS AMAZON!"
"I purchased two bags of this dogfood, after one week of feeding the newman brand, my dog started vomiting after eating, she had gas all the time and lied around whimpering due to stomach ache, after having her checked for a stomach disorder, I took her off the newman dogfood and the symptoms disappeared.I have sent three emails to newman dogfood website, no replies or acknowledgement, phone number not available, the dogfood is expensive and THE CUSTOMER SERVICE IS NON EXISTENT."
"Just signed up for the Subscribe and Save option.  Saved a few bucks per bag versus the local store, and now it will show up every month.  Hopefully the rhythm will match the consumption rate of my two dogs! (the shortest shipping interval is 1 month, but you can trigger an immediate delivery if needed)"
I don't know why this got such good reviews but my Yorkshire really doesn't like it. He likes Iams more than this and it's cheaper.
"I feed my dog Royal Canine brand which I typically have to mix with chicken stick or wet canned food for her to eat - I thought this stuff would be more flavorful and easy to serve.  Upon opening I could tell I made a mistake - smells like cardboard - my dog won't eat it no matter how I dress it up, much less could I get her to eat it plain.  Plus, it has none of the science behind it like higher end brands like Royal Canine - the Newman brand is spreading itself too thin here - they should stick with pasta sauce."
I had to pick up a grocery store brand after running out of our regular Innova dog food. I fed this to my 160lb dog for a week and could not believe the amount of waste this brand produced! He was going up to 10 times a day! Unbelievable! This just goes to show how much filler is in this food. Would never recommend.
"This food is organic, sure.  However, look at the ingredients, top 7 includes chicken meal.  Never feed your pet anything with chicken meal or chicken by product.  It's a cheap substitute, and really is bad for the dog.  I suggest a brand like Evo, Blue Buffalo, ect.  No ingredient should be meal or by product."
"I guess my animals (cat and dog) can't read the amous names on bag warpings, as they almost refuse to eat this stuff unless nothing else available and they are hungry."
"I have 4 dogs and all were sick on this food. One actually almost died. It had to be ressucitated. After I spent $4,000.00 on Vet's bills I decided to call the FDA to analize this food. They found Ethoxyquin on it - a pesticide. [...] I just want to make sure if someone out there has the same problem, that it must be known. I'm still not happy about this incident. I decided not to pursue it any longer, but I still feel people should know. These 'Organic' companies can't get away misleading people. If everyone exposed them, then this would be a better world. Think about it...<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000YQMB1G"">Newman's Own Organics Chicken Rice, Advanced Dry, 25-Pound</a>"
"Chicken MealNOT legally allowed in human foodSubject to only the less-stringent animal food safety standardsMay contain ""4-D"" chicken products:* Diseased chickens* Chickens that were Dying prior to butchering* Chickens that were Dead prior to butchering* Disabled chickens (may carry more infections)RenderedMay contain waste products* Restaurant waste* Meat processing facility waste* Packinghouse wasteNot subject to testing for quality standards or nutrient levels, may vary widely from batch to batch"
The number one ingredient is chicken... not organic chicken just the hormone pumped junk you wouldn't eat yourself. I will stick to Natural Balance which is sold here on Amazon as well.
"I put this in my dogs bowl and the first time, my dog,Bob Saget, just licked the bowl clean same ol same ol. Then! I put in some Uranium Ore and bamy waowi HE TURNED GREEN!!! Good results. The next day his eyes startes to glow and, when I took him for his daily stroll he looked at the neighbors cat and it levitated and exploded Good results. I think I'll try some my I have a few people that the world dosen't need :-)"
"I will never again even CONSIDER a dog food with corn, wheat or soy in it. Grain has no place in a dog's diet!"
"I HAVE TO SAY IN THE BEGINNING..I HAVE NOT TRIED THIS FOOD, IT HAD ME SOLD. I SAID OH BOY! ITS MADE BY PAUL NEWMAN IT ""HAS"" TO BE GOOD! THIS SHOULD ""NOT BE CATARIZED ""ORGANIC""!! ITS DECEITFUL. IT SHOULD BE ADVERTIZED AS PARTIALLY ORGANIC! THEN YOU WONT BE UPSET THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING YOU WANT TO BE ORGANIC---THE MEAT---IS NOT! WHO CARES IF YOUR VEGGIES R ORGANIC? WELL YEH IT HELPS DEF BUT THEY DONT NORMALLY RAISE VEGGIES WITH ANTIBIOTICS ETC ETC!SO IF ORGANIC IS WHAT UR LOOKING FOR WALK UP THE AISLE TO CASTOR AND POLLUX ORGANIX DOG FOOD! EVERY SINGLE INGREDIANT ""IS""  O  R  G  A  N  I  C  !!!SHAME ON YOU THE COMPANY OF ONE OF MY FAV ACTORS! IM TRULY SURPRISED HE LET THIS BE UNDER THE REVIEWS OF ORGANIC!"
"I cannot express enough how pleased I am with this dog food. I feed my 11 year old German Shepard, and my two year old Pittie Girl this food every day, and the benefits are astounding.  For most of my Shepards life I fed her a well known, vet recommended food, and yet she always had stomach problems.  Trying many things, it was not until I rescued, and I should really say she rescued me, and the dog food recall, that I began doing research on brands of food.  After a long investigation, I decided on Newman's Own, not only because there had been no recall on the food, but because of the ingredients, and that the proceeds going to charity. Now, choosing this brand, would mean that I would have to order it online, because my local stores did not carry it, but that was all right with me, because not only do I enjoy online ordering, but I am an older, disabled woman, and getting to the store and hauling in packages is very hard for me.  Well, I want to tell you, My 11 year old thrives on this food, with no more digestive issues, and a beautiful white coat, and she loves eating it with vigor. My two year old American Pit Bull Terrier, another love of my life, also thrives on this food, has the most beautiful shiny coat ever, and people say all the time how beautiful her coat is.  I do spoil my fur kids, but their health and well being is my number one priority.  I have just recently switched over feeding my 4 cats Newman's Own cat food, both dry and canned food, and since then, I have noticed the difference in the elimination of hair balls.  I know that I am truly a pet lover, but I believe that if you love your pets and want only the best well being for them, unnecessary medical issues, and all around good health, a good balanced, safe, natural food is the way to go.  I highly recommend Newman's Own dog and cat food.  I also feed my two dogs Newman's Own biscuits as treats."
"I adopted a dog that was raised by a bunch of frat age boys.  You can imagine the diet she had; Burgers, fries, ice-cream, and the cheapest dog foods on the market.No, she wasn't crazy about Newman's dog food when I switched her to it.  But if you think about how people react to a healthy diet in the beginning it makes sense.  It takes time for the taste buds to adjust and not want the artificial ingredients put into most of the food out there.It has been almost a year.  My dog, Molly, is bouncy and healthy and almost allergy free. She gets dry Newman's fed free style, and 4 ounces of Newman's canned every day.  Her weight stays stable at 65 pounds which is perfect for her. Her treats are real meat jerky strips a few times a week.On another note, this diet has made doggy duty much easier. She never vomits anymore. Her scat is always firm, making her easy to clean up after.  She is regular as clock-work.  All these plusses make it more enjoyable to be a dog owner."
"Our dog is 13 years old and for the last couple of years, his stomach has become particularly sensitive. We tried various brands of dog food before settling on Newman's Own. Our dog loves it and has not had any more trouble with his stomach. It is hard to find though. I was buying it from a small local organic grocery store but they only carried it in the smallest size and I was paying almost twice as much as on Amazon. Now I have it set up on Amazon to ship monthly."
"We have been using Newman's organic dry dog food for over 5 years...it was a Godsend when we discovered it. Our little Jack had such severe allergies she was tormented day and night with unrelieved itching...after trying endless other avenues to find relief for her we were to the point we thought we might have to have her put down for her to find relief. Then the idea came up that maybe she had chemical sensitivities...so we decided to go organic...all her deals miraculously cleared up once we started the Newman's. However after giving glowing reviews for many years, we now have to concede something has changed...our little Jack's itching returned to the point of drawing blood. It is clear something changed and I believe it clearly is no longer as organic as it once was...we are on the hunt again. I am not saying it does not have good quality ingredients...but if you have a dog that is highly chemical sensitive...this likely is not for you. Too bad...it once was a superior product."
"I've yet to find any of the dogs I know that love it.  I still have my allergic dog eating it, but she has to be hungry to eat this without doctoring.  My vet doesn't want me feeding her people food so I add some of Newman's or Happy Hips canned to it.I've talked to a couple of vets about prescription diet and they all push the big company brand names.  The common objection appears to be the soy used in Newman's to increase the protein count.I am willing to put a little flavor in this to feed may dog high quality, social responsible food.I may be the only person who has made the following mistake but, assuming you catch the Amazon sales, make sure you are ordering the bag size you want.  I thought I was getting a good price on one order until the food came and it was the seven instead of twelve pound bag."
"I originally bought this as a replacement for Science Diet's I/D as it was always much more expensive than anything else out there. I/D was also more expensive than Newman's at my local vet's office. I have had a ton of issues getting my dog to accept other dog foods in the past. We tried pretty much every brand that you can buy in pet shops and always had problems with my dog scratching or having her ears get bright red. We found out the problem after one of the cases where she almost went into renal failure after eating her Milkbone treats. We needed something organic without a lot of beef in it. While this one does have some bi-product for protein, it doesn't seem to bother my dog at all. She also has normal stools every time which wasn't the case even with the I/D. My dog hated the I/D. She would often leave a good portion of it on the ground or in the bowl and rarely ate it in its entirety. With the Newman's own it is night and day. She scarfs it down in less than a couple minutes and usually eats a bowl in one sitting. It seems like she loves it from the way she eats it.A couple of the reports from reviewers originally scared me about the reports of scratching which was exactly the problem I had with other dog foods. I gave it a try and my husky has never had a problem since and she has been on it for almost three months now. My husky has always had problems with digestive issues and this seems to be one dog food that she likes and does not have problems with.On a side note, I wish Newman's offered a bigger size bag. I have to order these all the time due to the 12.5 pound bag. My husky kills a bag in roughly two weeks due to her size. It still works out being cheaper than the $50 bag of 17 pound I/D I was ordering so I'm still happy with it. Science diet was sending me to the poor house."
"I adopted my dog about 6 months ago and he had digestive problems that the vet could find no cause for. He would get diarrhea with mucous in stools regularly. His stools would vary from constipated to unformed soft stool. I decided to switch him to a better quality food and did a lot of research. Newman's Own had all the qualities I was looking for, so I switched him to it gradually - 1/2 Purina One and 1/2 Newman's Own at first and gradually more Newmans' Own in the mix until finally 100% N.O. Ever since switching about six weeks ago, he has not had constipation or loose stools. I also don't hear his tummy roiling after meals like before. And despite what a few reviewers have written, the chicken and beef used in the pet food, while not ""organic"", is ""natural"" and raised without hormones and antibiotics.According to [...] ingredients list: ""Natural Chicken - Raised without growth hormones and antibiotics and fed only a 100% natural, all-vegetable diet, the chicken meat provides amino acids essential for muscles, hormones, enzymes, antibodies and structural and protective tissues."" Also, the beef is free-range anad range fed w/ no hormones & antibiotics.For me the evidence is clear - this is good quality food, my dog loves it and I love that when I buy Newman's Own products, the royalties go to charity!"
"I subscribe to the 12.5 lb bag of Advanced Dog Formula for Active or Senior Dogs - it's a great value. We have a small border collie mix and she absolutely loves this food. I feed it to her in a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0006G54OU"">Buster Food Cube Large Size (Colors May Vary)</a> and she can't wait for mealtime every day!We got her from the shelter where she was on Science Diet. She had a ton of skin issues (formerly had fleas, patches of bare skin, itchy dry skin, and dandruff flakes). Since we changed over to Newman's, the skin problems have almost gone away. It's been about 2 months and she has her fur growing back in the problem areas, she has less dandruff and I've noticed a lot less scratching from her in general. Our dog trainer said it was most likely due to the change in diet.Her BMs are solid and very regular. They are also not particularly smelly. I have never smelled any gas from her since putting her on the food. These are all signs that she is on a great diet!Also, I love the subscribe feature because I don't have to lug heavy bags of dog food from my car to my 3rd floor apartment!"
"We've been feeding this food to our wheaten terrier for a year, with happy results - until last Tuesday, when my latest subscribe-and-save bag was opened: my dog started throwing up during the night after eating from this new bag. On the first night, I figured she'd eaten something bad off the street. On the second night, I figured it was the lingering effects of eating something bad off the street. On the third night, I started looking for other causes for the nighttime retching, and I realized that the vomiting had started on the same day as we'd started the new bag. I stopped feeding the dog the Newman's Own and the vomiting stopped for 2 nights. Last night, I fed her the food again, and sure enough, she threw up in the night.I trusted and liked this food - and all things under the Newman's Own brand - but i'll never buy their products again. They clearly have a dangerous quality control problem."
"We have a pug that suffers from chronic ear infections and skin problems.  We've consistently kept him on expensive brands that are well known for having good ingredients like California Natural, Chicken Soup for the dog lover's soul, Royal Canin, and a couple others that I can't remember off the top of my head.My Mom picked up this Newman's food because it was available at the grocery store.  They love the food, but what really surprises me is that his ears and skin have improved dramatically.  His stools are also much firmer and way less stinky than before.  This food seems like a real winner for us."
"since we began using this several years ago our senior dogs raely need to visit the vet. When we were feeding a well know premium petstore brand  we were there at least 1 time every six weeks. they love the taste of newmans it keeps their tummy in tip top shape. NO more food alergies. No more vomiting, Made with bells & evans chicken the same chicken sold at whole foods & other organic food sellers. If its good enough for you, it's good enough for them. All Mr Newmans profits go to animal shelter and rescue organization. Give this food 12 weeks see the improvememnt yourself."
"I really want to like this product because of the great things Newman's have done and the fact that all the proceeds go to charity. I like the fact that the ingredients are all top quality and organic. It looks and smells good too. Unfortunately, none of this matters to my dog Daisy. She just doesn't care for it. Usually she will sniff it and walk away. Once she realizes nothing else is coming her way she will usually eat it but I feel bad since she obviously doesn't care for it. Like I said, I really want to like this product, but my dog has the final say. Sadly, I don't think I will buy it again."
"Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets.  After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.  Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years.  After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat.  That may be age related as well.  But the stomach upsets have stopped.  And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula."
"I switched my mini-Schauzers over to Newman's Own Organics a month ago when they came off of their puppy chow.  I've been looking for a good quality dog food (rated 4 stars by dogfoodadvisor.com) without going into debt purchasing it!  I was feeding them a different brand that was ""breed-specific"" food, but was having trouble trying to find it in stock anywhere.  A few places, if they carried it at all, only carried the very small bags (2.5 lbs) and with two dogs, one bag would last about 3 - 5 days.  Plus these little 2.5 lb. bags cost more than half what the larger 10 lb. bag  cost!  I tried to make an arrangement to have one of the places order the larger bag for me, but they conveniently ""forgot"" to place the order, so I was stuck purchasing the ridiculously more expensive small bags.  Then I heard about Newman's Own Organics, which is rated a better dog food than the ""breed-specific"" food I was using and cost $$$ less!  And then I discovered that I could buy this food at Amazon.com, have it shipped on a regular basis to my home with no shipping costs and a discount on the food for signing up for the subscription plan delivery - no brainer!!  No more running out of food, no more driving 50 miles or more to find it, no more hassels!And best and most importantly of all, my little guys LOVE IT!!  Their stools firmed up almost immediately after starting the switchover, they seem more active, more alert, more regular and they actually chew this food (they inhaled their puppy chow without chewing!)  I can't say enough good things about both Newman's Own and Amazon's subscription delivery service!"
"I have a dachshund.  I have fed her Newman's Own Senior Formula for the past few years.  I used to feed her Eukanuba, but then when there was that pet food scare with China, I started to investigate and found out that Eukanuba contained the same undesirable chicken parts as the cheaper dog foods.  I wasn't happy.  I contacted Newman's about whether the products in this food are sourced from the U.S. and I was told by one of their scientists that they are.  Recently, I moved and was unable to get Newman's locally, so I tried a couple other organic brands.  My dog didn't like them and she seemed to have a larger stool.  I decided to go back to Newman's and order from Amazon, who I can always count on to carry everything.  Now she's happy and so am I!  And, we're supporting a great cause, because Newman's doesn't compromise on quality and also supports charitable endeavors.  What more could you ask?One important thing to consider - if you have a senior dog, it is important to feed them the senior formula so they can digest the food easier."
"I had been buying all sorts of super-premium, super expensive foods.  My local stores kept discontinuing them.  So I did my research and found Newman's Own Organic.It is certified organic with no hormones, antibiotics or chemical additives, corn or wheat.And my dogs love it (of course they eat anything including grass and bird food and several unfit to post on line)."
"This food is a vast improvement over the store bought crap. My dog's coat got softer within days, his breath stopped stinking immediately and he smells a lot better. He is more active and seems healthier and happier. No more rendering plant floor sweepings for my dog! $20 a month is a small sacrifice to make for my dog's health and well being. I honestly don't know why everyone isn't more concerned about what kind of inedible junk they put in regular store bought dog food."
"One of my dogs had irritable bowel syndrome which we tried to address with food from the vet, raw food, and every kind of dog food in a pet store.  A friend told me about Newmans and how it cleared up her dog's stomach problems.  One day later - firm stools, no gas, happy dog, ecstatic dog parents!  My other dog is 10 and is often mistaken for a puppy due to her good energy and coat.  I am so glad we found this food!"
"Both of my dogs had trouble with this formula, allergy wise.  It took me a couple of days to realize that their itching was related to the food.  Needless to say I won't buy this product again."
"I have given my dogs every expensive dog food there is, Orijin, Blu, Merrick...you name it, and even though they were good this one is the best.  No upset tummies during the switch to this dog food either.  Even my senior dog who always has loose stool now has a firm healthy stool. Plus, Newman's Own gives all their profits to charity so it really is the best as far as I'm concerned."
"When one purchases a product that is called Newman's Organics, one would expect organic food.  Not just the vegetables, which are much less expensive to be organic than the meat or chicken.  I was very, very disappointed to find out that the chicken is not organic.  For a couple of dollars more, just buy real organic dog food. This dog food isn't exactly cheap, so you expect that they will provide what they are advertising.  This whole ""greenwashing"" thing needs to be regulated better.  If someone uses the word organic in their description, it better be organic.  Otherwise the consumer is being deceived which is unfortunate.  Newmans has a great reputation, I buy a lot of their products, but this was intentionally deceptive and it makes me reconsider buying anything from them in the future.On the positive side, my dog loved it, she would lick the bowl around the room for 20 minutes after the last morsel was consumed.  I have no idea what they put in it that tasted so good, it's like the crack cocaine of dog food.  She has never been a finicky eater, she'll pretty much eat anything voraciously, but this stuff really rocked her epicurean world.  Too bad she isn't getting any more of it."
"My foster dog, Rex, came to me severely underweight with nutrient defficiencies and digestive issues.  After a few weeks of prescription food, I phased him into Newman's Own Advanced Formula.  Not only does he love it, but he's gaining weight marvelously and digests it easily.  It was recommended by many, and has minimal to no fillers.Personally, I enjoy the product because as a life-long vegetarian, it was important to find a food with strict animal compassion practices, and Newman's Own apparently has those.  It's affordable as well.  Sticking with it!"
"This is a great dog food product - healthy, organic and great for sensitive tummies!Our Lhasa Apso is nine years old, is a picky eater and has a very sensitive stomach. We started feeding him Newman's Own Organics dog food about 4 years ago and are really, really satified with this product. He rarely gets sick, eats almost every meal we give him, though sometimes he makes us wait for him to finish his breakfast but that's okay! With other dog food products he would stop eating them completely or get sick frequently - even the expensive brands we tried from the animal hospital.At first the only place we could buy Newman's Own was from a local, privately owned pet store which was very expensive but worth it since he stopped getting sick so frequently. I was delighted to buy it on Amazon. The price for the 12.5 lb bag is slightly more than what we were paying for the 7 lb bag locally. I am a Prime member so was able to get this without paying for shipping. I will certainly order it again when we get close to running out.Thank you Amazon!!"
"My dogs love this food.  I have fed my 11 year old German Shepard and my three year old American Pit Bull Terrier for almost three years. They have thrived so well on this food, my shepard no longer has stomach problems ... both their coats are beautiful and I am completely satisfied.  When I decided to switch foods, I did alot of research on what good, healthy, mostly organic food to switch them to. I chose Newman's Own, not because I could purchase it easily at a local store .. because I can not do so, I have to order it and have it delivered, but because of the ingredients, how it is made, and because most of the proceeds go to charities. I found the best price at Amazon, and will always order it this way.  I truly recommend this dog food to everyone."
"I have not tried this product personally, but my dog has, and he loves it, and is aging well. He's getting a bit grey, but is as bouncy as he ever was 10 years ago."
"Have two cocker spaniels.It was a challenge to find the right dog food forthe older one, as he would get very gassy. I triedat least 5-6 different brands with no success. Thenanother cocker spaniel owner recommended me this one.NO MORE GAS!!Both of them love it. Their coat is looking so muchshinier and healthier. And they now shed very less.I would'nt feed my dogs anything else now.Very highly recommended!And the price and service from Amazon is unbeatable!!"
"Our dog has always been a little on the lazy side, and his coat has been fairly unhealthy-looking relative to other dogs we've had in the past. When he began to start smelling on top of it, we decided to change his dog food to see if perhaps his stomach was becoming upset by his current food.After about a week on the new food, he had noticeably more energy and his coat started to become much healthier. On top of that, the odor that he emitted started to subside until it was no longer there.We really didn't expect it to be so drastic. We're very happy with Newman's Own dog food."
"I have three dog friends. Maggie, my 14 year old Aussie had some problems($2,000.00) worth of problems and she was so sick I thought of putting her down. As it turns out there were several issues that the Colo Springs Emergi Vet and Dr Jaime Gaynor fixed and one of them one food allergies that had caused severe problems. After trying several foods and making all my own dog food we tried Paul Newman and all was well, Maggie and her friends thrived. Well Our grocery stores did not always have it in stock and it ranged from 13 to 17 dollars for 7 pounds, also at Wal Mart is was past its expiration date and rancid. Thank you Amazon, it comes fresh!It is so reasonably priced and it gets delivered on schedule which I can change at anytime as far as amount and delivery date. I cannot thank you enough for carrying this food nor recommend it enough for other dogs.Our lives are busy, I am a nurse and anything that is dependable, easy, reasonable, comes with excellent customer service, and my friends Maggie, Lucy, and Honey stay healthy on it a gift for every day, Thank you"
"I was a little skeptical about switching over to this brand but I'm happy to say, my dog loves this stuff. I don't even need to add leftover meat scraps or gravy sauce like I did to his old food. This stuff is way better than the crap they sell at those chain stores. Can't beat the price with S&S! Also love that they come in smaller resealable bags which keeps the food fresh. Better to open up a brand new bag every couple weeks than to leave a huge opened bag of kibble in the pantry for months."
"Prior to switching to Newman's Own Organics Dog food, my 4 year old shih-tzu was crunching on Iams. Which was fine, except that every 2-3 months or so he'd have stomach problems. After switching, his poops have been firmer, no stomach issues in sight, AND his coat has gotten glossier (and much less flaky). Duncan likes his new food and so do I!"
My cocker puppy 4 mos threw up castor and poullex and Natural balance and had loose motions. SO i tried this and he did great ! even the red streaking from his eyes have almost cleared up after a month along with similasan eye drops. which is great.
I like Newman's Own for my family due to its consistent quality and good ingredients; I like have the opportunity to provide the same quality products to my animals.  Amazon makes it convenient to get multiple bags in manageable sizes that appear on my front porch according to my schedule.  I got the three four-pound bags; talk about portability and storability!
"My new Yorkie came from a puppy mill. She was clean and well groomed. She was not ever in a house. When I got her home she was so scared and nervous from the strange surroundings. She would not eat or drink and had horrible watery mucous bowel movements. After a visit to the vet that showed no  parasites we put on the bland diet. I researched organic dog food and was very impressed with the reviews of this food. No one in my area, Lancaster PA. has this product. I sent for it and weaned her off the bland diet. After only two days on this food her poops are solid small and firm. I am so thankful. She is really doing well and she is a very sweet girl and looks at me with grateful brown eyes."
Dogs love the taste and I love the company. Especially convenient to have it delivered rather than me lugging it home.
We switched up from nutro chicken and rice to newmans own and chip's bowel movements are so much more dense and compact. our vet says its a sign of good food. nuff said.
My 3 dogs love this food and are thriving on it.  Ingredients are high quality and Amazon price is better than anywhere I can get it except on sale.
"I have been feeding this to my Standard Poodle for quite some time. It was recommended by a local dog day care/grooming/training center called Great Dog Shoppe in Seattle. They are VERY specific about which foods they suggest and sell. It must meet certain standards of nutrition or it's no-go. My poodle loves it, but even better, I offered some to my cousin's finicky poodle who ""just doesn't eat when she's away from home"". She gobbled it right up and asked for more. When I compared the contents of Newman's to her brand (which was suggested by a breeder) there was NO comparison. Newman's Own is far superior. I get it via ""subscribe and save"" so I never run out, I save over the store price and it's delivered right to my door. What could be easier?"
"I used to buy this at a local health food store and then they stopped carrying it. Then I was thrilled when I found it Wal-Mart, but then they stopped stocking the dry kibble and now only carry the Newman's doggie mush in cans. So, I couldn't believe it when I found it here - Amazon really does sell just about everything! My Shih Tzus like it and they do not get sick at all like they did periodically on the non-organic but still expensive, ""vet-recommended"", brands."
"Human-grade chicken, all organic dog food.  The food is delivered to me monthly on schedule via the Subscribe & Save program.  The profits benefit pet charities.What's not to like?"
"I like that this is a reasonably priced organic dog food that is readily available. I switched to this when the brand I had been feeding my dogs for years began to upset the tummy of my senior. However, neither of my dogs (even my ""chowhound"") is crazy about it. They eventually did eat it, but it took a lot of coaxing. But the tummy problems did clear up."
"Our dog LOVES this food!  He was having serious gastrointestinal problems that weren't clearing up -- until we started him on Newman's Own.  Since then, he has been regular, happy, and healthy."
"I have a 10 year old Aussie shep/heeler mix with chronic skin allergies -- I tried him on every premium dog food including grain free protein only formulas -- and none helped.  Other organic dog food also make him itch miserably.  But on the Newman's Own he's stopped the itching and shedding, and he absolutely devours this stuff.  LOVE IT!!!!"
"I am very happy I switched from a very popular dog food, sold in a lot of vets offices to Newmans about 3 years ago after a bout of stomach distress. All has been well with my fur baby ever since ;-) And to have it brought right to my front door for cheaper than I can get it at the local store, how can you beat that?"
"I, like most people, switched to organic after the dog food scare and after trying a lot of different foods, settled on this one.  My dogs like it and I feel good about it feeding it to them."
"As other viewers have pointed out, this dog food contains pesticides and grains, among other questionable ingredients. The experience with this brand has been disappointing. I appreciate Newman's Own brand but I no longer trust them with dog food and have questioned some other products from them.I have since switched to Blue Buffalo, as they seem to have the best reputation.""Stacey""'s review sold me on it:""Dog food has changed ALOT over the past few years. As pet owners were willing to spend more money feeding their pets, larger corporations bought out the smaller dog food companies and changed the ingredients without notifying the customers. This was particularly true of the more expensive brands that contained the higher quality ingredients. Real meat and rice were substituted with ""meat by-product"" and cheap imported grains (particularly CORN) that were determined to be ""unfit for human consumption"". They are taking ingredients that used to be considered ""waste"" and packaging it up as ""healthy & nutritious"" food for your beloved pet. Our once healthy pets are contracting debilitating diseases and dying because of the toxic waste materials that are currently being marketed as pet food.Blue Buffalo is one of the few remaining companies that, at least to my knowledge, has not ""sold-out"" yet. The food really is nutritious and still contains real meat with no by-products, fillers, corn or soy. We switched our dogs over this past summer after having lost one to an autopsy/toxicology verified case of ""aflatoxin poisoning"" from the ""healthy & nutritious"" dog food we were buying and feeding him. This was NOT cheap food folks. This was a well-known brand, highly marketed as ""Natural"", that we were paying $60/bag for. The FDA analysis of this food verified that it contained toxins, but NOTHING was done to the dog food manufacturer. They are still producing their ""high priced waste"" and heavily marketing it as ""natural"".My advice to pet owners: Read the ingredients labels thoroughly and often! Blue Buffalo a great product that you can still feed your pets with confidence. Because it doesn't contain any cheap fillers, it's more satisfying to your dog so you don't need to feed as much of it thus making it still relatively economical. Don't wait until it's too late for your beloved pet. """
"I have three dogs.  Two of the three would normally eat just about anything that you put in their bowls.  The third one (a Yorkie), has always been pickey. For the past couple years I had been buying those expensive brands of food that promise ""natural ingredients and better health"". I decided to try Newman's Own.  None of my dogs seem to be crazy about this food (no disrespect to the late Mr. Newman).  If I mix Newman's Own with another brand, the dogs make an effort to pick out (eat) the ""other"" food and they will tend to leave Newman's Own in the bowl.  If they are hungry and nothing else is available, they will eat the Newman's Own. I am not here to ""knock"" Newman's Own.  I am simply telling you my experience. BTW: The food is not old. It does not smell stale or old."
"The dogs had been eating Purina for a long, long time. I switched to Newman's Own and I noticed something only a dog owner would be conscious of...the waste. They no longer expel foul odorous waste, which Purina seemed to do to them regularly. Since they've been on Newman's, their waste is almost odorless and, well...it is easy to pick up. You can tell it's nutritious by what comes out, and if you have to pick up after your dog daily, like myself, you'll appreciate the cleaner output."
"My goldendoodle is picky and likes to change up his food once in a while. So I decided to try two other brands....what a mistake. Newman's own is really the best: my dog looks better, feels better, and the quality of food is very good. Do not do like I did and experiment around...my poor dogs stomach....stick with Newmans."
"I switched to this food from Blue Buffalo. I hate to say it, but around the time Blue started doing tv commercials the food started upsetting my dog's stomach. Perhaps that's a coincidence, but it was a reason to switch regardless of the timing. The Newman's food has been great. My dog loves the food. He has been energetic and in great health. Not much more that you could ask. The bag of treats that comes in the 12.5 lb bag is a fantastic bonus to every bag."
"I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food!"
"This solved my pups dog food allergy problems when I started purchasing it (I have a husky and a german shepherd), but several months ago the itching started again; the color and size of the kibble even noticeably changed. I wrote a letter of inquiry to Newman's, with batch numbers from the bags, but have received no answer. Since then, I've purchased both Solid Gold Wolf King and Royal Canine 24 German Shepherd and the dogs are doing okay again."
"I bought this for my miniature schnauzer who is about 17 pounds and I feed her a heaping cup everyday. Also sprinkled on top is glucosamine pills <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00028ZLL8"">Nutramax Cosequin Regular Strength Capsules - 180 Count</a>, to help with joint health. I purchased this brand of dog food for my 7 year old mini schnauzer based on the reviews alone. She never has had any digestive problems or issues and also isn't a very picky eater so I cannot attest to these two things. Her stool is firm is easy to pick up from eating this dog food and I have not had any issues with her having diarrhea or runny stool. She has been on Newman's Own Organic dog food for about 6 months and I plan to keep feeding her this.If you want your dog to have a healthy and long life, you will want to feed them the best like this organic dog food. Try avoiding feeding table scraps and make sure they have plenty of exercise.Make sure you sign up for Subscribe and Save for that extra 15% off.****EDIT 04/10/2012Edited to say that Amazon now only has 5% off for Subscribe and Save. Also the latest bag I received also came with a full size sample bag of treats <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045XE32E"">Newman's Own Organics Lamb and Barley New Zealand Ranch Style Dog Treats, 10-Ounce (Pack of 6)</a>. It sells for $23 for 6 on Amazon!"
"My Chiweenie was having issues with dandruff, constipation and a dull coat. We researched different dog foods and bought Newmans Own for Active or Senior dogs. In about 3 weeks, its like having a brand new dog. He is so soft, dandruff free, having healthy 'movements' ;) and he loves the food. I can give him a piece of it as a treat and he really thinks it is, ha ha. Moral of the story, we will never go back to bargain brand. For just a little bit more our dog is healthier, softer, happier and its worth it."
My dog's love it. Made from excellent ingredients and a great price at Amazon.com. My Chihuahua has allergies and I've noticed she isn't scratching or chewing on her paws anymore.
"It's all organic and it's on PETA's (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) list of ""CRUELTY-FREE"" brands.  Did you know that the leading brands of dog foods conduct horrible and cruel tests on laboratory dogs?  Plus it is delivered to my door and no shipping charge (Super Saver Shipping), and costs less than the product I used to buy, saving me time and money. Oh yeah, and my dogs love it!<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00139TT72"">Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula, 12.5-Pound Bag</a>"
"I have a two-year old Jack Russell Terrier and she loves Newman's Own Dog Food! She ate Beneful for a year before switching. This goes down much easier. She doesn't each eat it ""just because she's hungry""; she actually likes it! I highly recommend this product and would consider giving any dog nothing less!"
My dog loves it and she doesn't scratch at her ears anymore (she used to scratch her ears all the time because she kept an ear infection!)
My two small dogs took to the food immediately so well in fact I have had to move up the subscription for the 12 pound bag. Since they are young its not immediate if they look healthier or bouncier as they seem to be that way all the time. What I have noticed is there business is allot more controlled and any problems such as regurgitation which I had in past products have gone away. If your a prime member I would suggest setting up a subscription and be rid of of the chore of last minute runs to buy dog food and also know you are giving your pets a quality tier of dog food.
"This is going to be short and sweet.  My little (10&13 lbs) dogs love it, easy to eat small bits, and it's a high grade food souce for them.  What more can I say."
"I have been feeding this to my 13 yr old Beagle for years.  Newman's Own is of excellent quality and it's certified organic. Also, a large portion of sales are donated to charity."
The best dog food ever for my dog. He has a sensitive stomach and not only does he love it but it totaly agrees with him.  My vet also feels it's a great product. Even my dogs teeth are cleaner since being on it.
"Newman's Own has been an excellent choice for my dog. The ingredients are organic and high quality; her coat is beautifully conditioned and she has never had an allergic response as with some of the more expensive products from the vet's office. Also, she is a small dog and the kibble bits are easy for her to chew.  It was annoying that the price was reduced between the time of my order and the delivery, but Amazon made an immediate adjustment.  I like the 4-pound bags for freshness because my dog is small and takes awhile to eat that much, but there are other sizes available to suit larger dogs."
"I have a 3 year old Boston Terrier who is not only a picky eater, but most dog foods give him bad gas.  I searched high and low for several months for a dog food that would help with his stomach issues and finally found another brand of dog food that, while not organic, helped relieve the gas problem.After finishing a bag of the old brand, I stumbled across this on amazon one cold day and thought I'd take a chance and see if he'd like it or not.  I'm happy to report that he loves it AND it doesn't give him horrible gas at all.  His coat is shiny and healthy, as well.  The only downside I can see--like the other brand--is the price.  But being that the product is high quality and organic, I can't argue that too much.  Plus, with amazon's subscribe and save, I get it at a discount and delivered right to my front door.  You definitely can't beat that!Overall, I'm very satisfied with this and will continue to purchase."
My dog loved this food and he was a very picky eater.  I felt I was giving him healthy food with no fillers.  I also loved the convinence of having it sent to the house monthly.  Not having to shop and drag a big weightly item home was great.
"My dogs give this a high-five.  I've never tried it, but the list of ingredients is sound and it make their tails wag."
One of my dogs is allergic to almost everything in dog food.  Newman's Own for senior dogs makes all the difference in her health.
"I bought this dog food initally because I like everything that I have tried from Newmans Products for humans. So, I thought that my Pug, Chloe may like Newmans also. Well, she sure does, there is no turning up her nose at it. I get it delivered regualry, so this negates the need to make a special trip to get Dog food.UPDATE 6/12/15  the last two bags I recieved had a mite in the foods which caused my dog to have severe bouts of diarrhea. I only found out today when I took her to the vet, and was informed that these intestinal bugs were usually located in the dog food. Sure enough, when I got home and looked in the dog food, guess what I cfound on the bottom of the bag, tiny mites.......it went out into the garbage containers.I will return to this dog food in a few months......she ahs liked it so much, but will wait for a bit."
"My doogie loves it a lot, my budget howls though. I can't find it steadily at the local stores so catching it on sale is out of the question. It's great, no digestion problems and his skin, eyes and coat are much improved so I know it's good for him too.I've had great results with Harmony Farms Dog Food that I orderd through Amazon AND there's 5 pounds more for about the same price."
"My Dog is really ""Picky"" when it comes to his food and I usually have to mix his old with his new for a few days ""Until he will eat"" his new food. I opened the bag when my Order arrived and gave my dog a taste...... He loved his new food & this is his second 15 pound bag!"
I adopted a dog from rescue shelter who has an allergy to corn. I live in a small town and found no dog food that didn't contain mainly corn. This was perfect and my new pet is doing very well on it and loves it. It's an added bonus that it comes straight to my door.
My 72 lb dog has never refused to eat Newman's Own Organic.  I'm glad that there is a pet food made without 'junk' that I can feed my pet.
"and I love buying it for her. Not only is it a healthy organic meal, I personally like what the Newman Foundation does with their profits (after taxes) from their products.....$265 MILLION has been donated to various charities to date by their foundation. I buy Newman's Own products whenever I can (their spaghetti sauce is out-of-this-world...""Roasted Garlic""...YUM!).My dog has eaten this food for years and years until, out of the blue, my local grocer decided not to sell it anymore. I then had to grab a bag of food for her because we were out completely and decided to get Beneful. Apparently, her digestive system didn't like it and she ended up with bloody stools. That's when I came to Amazon.com (a GODSEND for people like me who have lame grocery stores to shop from) and found her Newman's Own dog food! I can always depend on Amazon.com. I've now got this on auto-delivery. I trust Newman's Own products and I know my dog is getting a well-balanced organic meal and it's Melamine-free."
"Newman's Own is the best dog food ever, in my opinion. My 12 year old white German Shepard eats and digests this food wonderfully. Before changing to this food a few years ago, she had digestive problems often, even though she was fed a ""so called good brand name food"".  My three year old pittie girl also eats this food, and loves it .. she is in perfect health. I would recommend it to anyone. My next door neighbor orders it now from Amazon for his pittie girl. Amazon is a wonderful place to purchase dog and cat food, groceries, and anything you need .. the prices are always good, and the specials are great! The specials are the best ever, and I was shocked to find out that a today ""Friday"" special price on Newman's Own dog food was automatically reflected in my subscribe and save item price of the Newman's Own.  Even though I just received a bag yesterday, I ordered two more today, and some Newman's Own cat food.  What other retailer would automatically do that for you .. none that I know of.  Amazon .. please continue to offer the Newman's Own dog food .. I would be lost without the delivery, since it is difficult for me to get out and shop and carry large items like bags of dog food.  Thank you for being here for me and Snowey and Sophie.  Linda"
"I have two small dogs who have [[ASIN:B00139ZPKM Newman's Own#0174;Organics Advanced Dog Chicken & Rice Formula, 12.5 Pound Bag]]  Their only treats were Cheerios.  When I switched to Newman's Own brand, I was pleasantly surprised to notice they stopped their occasional vomiting.  With all the trouble caused by lack of standards in the industry, I immediately thought ""if I can't trust Paul Newman's foods, whose can I trust"".  And, they love it."
My dog is allergic to most dog food.  I have used Newman's Own  dog food  for several years now and I am quite happy with it.  I live in a small town that is 60 miles away from the nearest big city and I am unable to obtain the dog food locally.  It is a real convenience for me to buy this from Amazon and the price is equitable.
"I was giving my dogs Science Diet Puppy food from the time I got them at 8 weeks. Science Diet changed the formula about 3 months ago and the food just did not smell or look right. It was very oily and fishy smelling, which I realize they did at more fish oil. After about three weeks of the new food, I noticed my puppies (well now 1 year olds) skin was very flaky like dandruff and they both had been continuous licking their paws. I took them to the vet and he said they had food allergies. He wanted me to take them off the Science diet and put them on pumpkin and pinto beans for 7 weeks. Well, under duress I tried it and my dogs did not eat for 3 days. I decided to try the Newman's organic and after about 4 weeks their coat looks so much better and the licking has really decreased. I am so glad I saw this food when I was doing research."
"My dog LOVES this food.  I really like that it is organic, especially with all the recent problems with other dog foods.  I will continue to buy this brand in the store.  I would rate the product as a 5.The problem I had was with subscribe and save.  I started out buying at a very decent price.  After only 2 months the subscription price had increased by almost 40%!!  No notice on the increase was sent to see if I still wanted it either.  I believe Amazon should send an alert and ask to confirm or cancel when there is an increase.  My other subscriptions have not had price increases like this one.  Subscription rating-- 1."
"I foolishly purchased the HARMONY FARMS Healthy & Holistic Adult Dog Food, since it had more for the same price(why it had good reviews is beyond me). My dogs will not touch the harmony farms, yet love this dog food. My 10 wk. old pup had ""slimmy poop"", until the day I feed her this food. Both my dogs love it.Newman's Own Organics Adult Dog Food Formula is the way to go."
The chicken is not organic. It is the MAIN ingredient. This is NOT organic dog food. It is marketing lies to fool you into thinking you are paying more for quality ingredients when you are not getting organic chicken.
"We only feed our dog dry food, and it has to be good dog food. Newman brands are high quality, and I can get it delivered on a periodic basis and a fixed price thru Amazon. Ginger likes it and it keeps her healthy. I have learned over the years that this man, and his company, are highly moral and deliver fine quality products they stand behind."
My three little dogs love this food and I love it too sense it is organic and has no animal by products.
"This dogfood has never been recalled, has protein as the first two ingredients, and is organic. Doesnt make my dog throw up like when she tries other dogfoods full of fat and fakeness. Cant get better!"
Excellent I needed a dog food without copper as an ingredient and found Newmansbon the Internet. It has proven to be a great choice and my dog had thrived
"I feel better about feeding this product to my dogs.  I was using another popular brand,but it contained a lot of fillers.  One of my dogs is ""pickier,"" so he would prefer a meatiertaste, but he does clean it up eventually."
"Good product. Dogs are vary satified with it.  Would like to have in a larger bag(20 lbs.), if this could/would be an option."
"My dog has been eating this food for the last three years.  Every food I fed him before this caused smelly gas problems.  He almost never has gas on this food.  Also, people often comment on how good he smells.  However, when he goes to grandma's and eats junk food for a week or two he always comes home smelling like a dog.  It's totally the food.  On top of that, he loves it.  Love it!"
"We were looking for an organic food after the melamine poisoning of pet food debacle. Newman's Own dry foods for cats and dogs are manufactured in the US per their corporate veterinarian. Newman's Own is up front about their ingredients. For an organic food it is affordable. Also it has been great at keeping skin issues under control. Lastly Newman's Own is listed as a ""More Responsible Pet Food Company"" on several websites."
Newman's Own Food is one of the best on the market.  It is a natural healthy food for my senior dog.
I am very pleased with this product and would definitely recommend it.  All 3 of my dogs (2 Jack Russells and 1 dachshund) enjoy Newman's Own Dog Food and I liked knowing it was organic.  The kibbles are a perfect size for easy chewing.  My dogs enjoyed Newman's Own for about 3 months but then only nibbled on it so I decided to alternate it each month with another dog food to give my dogs some variety.
"Researched the company, researched the ingredients. Customer Service people are great. Sent free coupons when e-mailed with a question about which of their cat foods best for my two kitties (regular or advanced).  Received good answers and not rote replies. This food is made in the USA with products from the USA and has all the ingredients I think are good for my cats. The two of them love, love this dry food and I have to ration it or they would chow day all day. I don't leave food out for any pet, cat or dog, to eat at will. They do not like Newman's canned food however so I don't force it on them."
"Once you try this gum, there is no turning back! I discovered this gum about 2 years ago and have not bought any other gum since. Try it and you will not be disappointed. My entire circle of family and friends now chew only this gum. The flavor last forever, the consistency stays new and does not get hard or mushy, you can blow bubbles if you like, and it does NOT stick to dental work, or anything else for that matter! There is no need for any other gum other than Ice Cubes, as far as I am concerned. Love this gum!"
"I love this seasoning on my popcorn. I have been looking for better toppings and better seasonings to have a more ""gourmet"" experience with popcorn. This is #1 for white cheddar. I use a premium popcorn kernel popped in an aluminum pot with a tablespoon of olive oil. After popping i toss the popcorn with spray butter and then shake on the seasoning. Yummy!"
"I used to buy Molly McButter cheese flavor seasoning, but it is no longer sold in stores.  This is sooooo much better anyways.  I pop popcorn in the air-popper, spray it with I Can't Believe its Not Butter, then shake this on - it is DELICIOUS!  Better than Smartfood..."
"I recently purchased this product and got a chance to try it out on some freshly popped popcorn. I was surprised this was so tasty! It has a mildly tangy white cheddar flavor, that's not too overpowering. This makes it easty to create a flavorful, savory snack without the extra calories. (As compared to potato chips or cheese crackers, for instance.) I hope to try the other flavors really soon."
Yup you might taste cheddar if you do not mind dumping 1/2 bottle in your popcorn. You would be better off purchasing a good brand of cheddar cheese and grating it on top of your popcorn.
"not a whole alot of cheddar taste. mostly salt. if your looking for seasoning to mimic the taste of white cheddar that you would find in a bad brought from the supermarket, this product wont do it."
"I picked this up at my local grocery store thinking it would be good, name brand and all.  It tasted terrible.  You have to add a lot of the seasoning just to taste anything, then when you finally taste it, it has a powdery fake taste to it.  I was extremely disappointed."
"After having to add butter to make it stick anyway, the cheese powder is kind of a gross addition. If you're expecting the same taste you get from pre-packaged flavored popcorn, this isn't it. The kids like it enough, but I can't eat it."
"I read reviews that were negative about the product but because it's the same brand that the theater uses I thought it would be as good.  However, I do have to agree that it is different and you do have to use the entire bottle to get the same flavor.  It was a little disappointing."
I love this white cheddar seasoning.  I used to get it at my local grocery store and then they stopped carrying it so I had to order online. I use it for popcorn but also when sataying spinach and it makes spinach taste creamy and yummy without a bunch of extra fat.
Bought this item after having it at our local theater. It is great at home and really good on more than just popcorn.
O thought this was going to be like the flavors you find in the  Imax theaters. This is quite not like it at all. It is  salty and you do have to put alot of it on to taste the cheddar. Overall if you are using it just for a seasoning salt its ok to add to veggies to give it a kick as well as potatoes. but overall to turn any thing into a real cheddar flavor this will not work.  3 stars because it does ok on veggies
I love the seasoning.  But when you take off that stupid plastic lid to remove the white plastic paper on the top of the bottle.  Becareful you can season your shirt just fine.  Absolute moron who designed that lid.
I'm hooked.  Some people may say this seasoning is too salty but I always add a little more salt to the popcorn along with the White Cheddar.
"Yes this is a bit salty, but most popcorn seasonings I tried are.  This one is the easiest to get because of Amazon.  Like another reviewer mentioned, it is more powdery than grainy which is a good thing.  This doesn't necessarily stick perfectly, but that's okay.  I use any bag of buttered microwave popcorn and put this on while it is still hot out of the bag.  I think it may Stick a little better when it's warm.  No matter though, I wind up eating it off the bottom of the bowl as I eat the popcorn anyway.One of my favorite combos on the popcorn is using this white cheddar and sprinkling it on with curry powder, yum.  You can combine it with just about any other fine spice powder or herb to make all kinds of gourmet style flavors.I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because it could be a little less salty.  But when I eat popcorn it for a flavor explosion and salt helps to create that."
Just thinking about this seasoning makes me want to make popcorn. The white cheddar is great. But then all of these Kernel Season's are great. I make plain popcorn and then enjoy sprinkling on different Kernel Season's per bowl of popcorn and even using 2 or 3 different ones on the same bowl of popcorn. Just start out sprinkling light and add to your personal taste.
"As the title says, this is the best of the Kernel Seasons savory/salty flavors. It complements the popcorn without overpowering it like the nacho cheddar flavor. It has a really nice cheese taste and it's powdery rather than grainy. It doesn't taste like I'm just pouring flavored salt on my popcorn. This is the flavor I originally tried at the movie theater that got me hooked on Kernel Seasons. Definitely pick this one up among your 5 or so flavors."
"Love this flavoring--all of them are actually pretty good. I sprinkle it on regular foods as well--not just popcorn. It is just salty and cheesy enough for a delicious treat. Also, the bottles last forever because a little goes a long long way! Enjoy :)"
"I love this seasoning.  I tried it at a local movie theater, and was wowed by it...Now I put it on garlic bread for an awesome change of pace, popcorn and baked potato !So many different idea come to mind in how to use this product it does not let you down.  powerful flavor.I have tried other brands, but this one is the best !!"
"This stuff is the PITTS!!  It had very little flavor and as another reviewer said it takes 1/2 a bottle to flavor the corn if you are using a hot air popper, even with their suggested heavy PAM dose....I threw the other half of the container in the trash.I tried Kraft Mac and Cheese with no luck, it just rolled off the popped corn, due to that being not a fine enough powder.It would be nice to find a very fine powder that adheres to the popped kernels like the Popcorn Factory.  My search continues.....maybe Barry Farms Cheddar Cheese powder?.....we'll see......"
"I have purchased both the seasoning jar and Kernel Seasons White Cheddar Popcorn already popped in a bag both from Costco.  Both are extremely salty!  The popcorn in a bag has the right cheese flavor but with that comes like half a days intake of salt per serving and you can taste it immensely.  Also when you shake the cheddar seasoning jar onto your own popcorn, to get a good cheese flavor, you have to use quite a bit which adds the taste of quite a bit of salt.  I don't understand why so much salt is necessary.  Furthermore, if you air pop your popcorn and then use the seasoning, the seasoning will not stick to your popcorn.  The popcorn needs to be popped in butter, margarine or oil.  After it is done, while it is still hot and greasy, you have to shake the seasoning on to get it to stick to the popcorn.  My favorite easy to find brand, which is not nearly as salty, is O-kee-dokee popcorn which you can find in chip isle at most grocery stores.  I have tried every brand of white cheddar popcorn out there I can find because I love it so much.  By far, this brand is the king of salt.  Another good easy to find brand which is not as salty as Kernel Seasons is the Quaker brand white cheddar popcorn cakes.  Cape Cod White cheddar popcorn is good as well but is also salty, although not as nearly as salty as Kernel Seasons. Kernel Seasons either needs to reduce the sodium content of their products, or create low sodium alternatives as well, in order to appeal to a bigger market group."
"I've ordered white cheddar cheese powder (I understand, now even more than before, that this is seasoning, not just cheese powder) several times for use on popcorn, and it's even a bit salty for my taste, but I like it. I wish I'd looked at the ingredients on this seasoning, because had I known it had three times the sodium content of the powder powder I normally get, I never would have ordered it. But it was a bit less expensive, so I thought I'd try it. By the time I put enough of it on popcorn to really taste cheese, it's so salty I can't eat the popcorn. Amazon immediately refunded my money when I brought this to their attention.So I guess I'll stick with my usual favorite."
Discovered this at a local movie theater and will never eat popcorn without it again.  It is sooooooo good.
"Not much really to say.  Good, but not great.I wish they allowed mixing and matching of this stuff.Having to buy six of just one flavor is a big commitment."
"I love white cheddar and was looking for something like what they used to have at a nearby movie theater.  Couldn't find any of that, but since the theater no longer has the toppings out, I'm sure it was an MSG issue.  No issue here, this tastes good, but I would agree that you have to shake a lot on to get a the flavor on most of the popcorn.  I find it best to shake a little, eat a layer, rinse and repeat.  This definitely tastes great and am glad I tried it."
"Comes with 6, bring 1 to the theater with you.Tastes good, it really adds to the bland flavor of regular popcorn. The best of the Kernal Season's flavors imo.Haven't tried it on anything else. They have other flavors for that."
The Kernel has rejuvenated popcorn.  Thankfully our local theater has it otherwise I'd have to take one of my own with me!
"I love this seasoning.  I pop a bowl of popcorn (in my Whirly Pop) and then sit down with my spray butter (I can't beleive it's not butter) and this seasoning... and there you go -- a low calorie, high-fiber snack.  My husband loves the Caramel."
This is a GREAT! seasoning but since the salt mix is so heavy you'll have toss it after using about 70% of it - Also when you first open a container you should dump it out then pour it back in to properly mix the seasoning (the salt seems to settle so I always keep a empty one and simply dump the newly opened one into the empty container). In any event after you use about 70% the salty taste will overpower the cheddar mix and become distasteful. Its obvious that the cheddar taste is MIXED with salt and its not a container of 100% cheddar flavor. In spite of this it tastes so good that I'm willing to spend a couple minutes making sure the flavor is properly mixed. Its 100% worth it!!
I purchased three flavors of popcorn salt to make gift baskets with popcorn on the cob.  The salt was a perfect accent!
"This is so good I came on Amazon to find it. I purchased it once at Ralph's and I haven't been able to find it sense..ugh! That's ok, because as usual trusty Amazon has precisely what I'm looking for..YAY!"
"I just ordered a six pack of this, but have been buying at the store for years.  Sometimes you can find it, sometimes not, but it is a very tasty addition to stove top popped popcorn.  You can add a little or a lot, and add salt if you need to.  It adds a tangy, savory flavor that won't stain your fingers or your clothes.  I love it!"
"I thought I was purchasing one container and it was a whole box - which is fine but I still haven't even finished the first shaker yet.  Taste is good - it doesn't ""stick"" to my air popped popcorn however - but still provides it a little extra flavor."
"Wonderful product! taste amazing! Wish i would have bought a mix box, because thats a lot of  cheddar lol"
I love this product.  The taste is great and I can still use it while participating in Weight Watchers.
My wife is addicted to this stuff. It is perfect with air popped popcorn. Just add the cheddar immediately after popping. Nothing else needed. Yum!
"I have been happily using Kernel Season's products for years, and they only get better.  A great variation for those of us who eat a lot of popcorn.  I use Smart Balance oil, and with any of the KS toppings, popcorn is a pretty light, healthy snack.  Highly recommended."
"I am a popcorn lover...lots of butter and just about any time of the day or night.  I have tried several different brands of popcorn seasoning in a number of different flavors.  The white cheddar seems to be the most consistently satisfying of all.  Kernal Seasonings offers their white cheddar topping, comparable to the very best others have, at about 1/3 the price.The flavor of the topping adds a subtle sweet taste but with a definite shart cheddar zing.  You will add what you think is enough to flavor a batch, but often find yourself adding more as you eat, simply because the taste and experience is so satisfying."
"The bottle says ""No MSG"" but this is actually false advertising.1. In the US, companies are only required to list MSG on the ingredient label as MSG if it is a pure form of free glutamate.2. It is true that this product does not contain pure MSG.3. Many of the ingredients listed contain VERY high levels of MSG (free glutamate), and are included BECAUSE they contain MSG.4. Both Disodium Inosinate and Disodium Guanylate are also included, which are pretty expensive to add, and are only added because they enhance the effects of MSG--they do nothing else. If Kernel Seasons really did not include MSG, there would be no point in adding these other additives (and it would be much cheaper not to add them).Some people choose to eat foods with MSG, and that's ok.  White Cheddar used to be my favorite Kernel Season's flavor before I learned how to read ingredient labels carefully.  If MSG doesn't bother you, go ahead and buy this if you want.  My husband is severely allergic to MSG, though, and when we were first learning to avoid MSG, labels like this caused him to be very sick.  Why not just remove ""No MSG"" from the package instead of misleading people?  This is really an unethical practice.I felt very disappointed and mislead when I discovered this.  Don't just take my word for it; go learn about the ingredients on the list."
This white cheddar popcorn seasoning tastes mostly like salt.  They should call it popcorn salt with a hint of white cheddar flavoring.  My husband and I loved this seasoning before it was in a plastic bottle; It used to have a lot of flavor; They must have changed the recipe! Not satisfied!
"Ordered those to surprise my friend, she loves oh henry, she loved them so much i think she ate up the whole packet within minutes!Nice.."
"After searching and finding many gross gluten free pretzels, subpar gluten free pretzels, and even ones that ""will do"" because I have to have GF, I've been frustrated and almost didn't buy these.  But, I did...and they're amazing!  I'm pretty sure these are made with magic and unicorns, because they're the only real gluten free pretzels out there.  My non-gluten free S.O. likes these more than his regular pretzels, too.My other concern was about cross-contamination, because come on--this is Snyder's we're talking about, and their factories and warehouses must be a nightmare full of gluten.  But, much to my surprise, these have been certified gluten free by the Gluten Free Certification Organization, run by the Gluten Intolerance Group.These are so worth every single penny you'll pay for them.  I always have at least 3 bags in my cupboards at all times, and I carry a bag with me whenever I travel anywhere."
"The pretzels are very good.  I like them better than other gluten free pretzels that I have tried.  I would be reordering them, but they are no longer on Prime and $10 shipping is way more than I am willing to pay."
"I love these pretzels so much, I prefer them to regular pretzels. I've previously purchased the 100-calorie pack bags, but these are great to have on hand to put out for guests. A stable in our cabinets. Try these!!"
"I have used this product before. For me, it is the best cat grass for your money. I have used another cat grass but more expensive and lasted less than this one."
"I used to buy this stuff all the time; I haven't seen it in years.  Whenever I tell my friends about it, they invariably give me fun ny looks - ""The best marinade EVER is this stuff I used to get, Chaka's MMMMMmmm sauce -"" ""Wait, what?"" ""Chaka's Mmm sauce.""  ""You've got to be kidding.""  Anyway, I prefer slightly vinegar-y sauces rather than sweet, and the spices in this are OUTSTANDING.  I was thrilled to find it on Amazon, so I ordered a quarter case.  I've given bottles to a few of my friends, and they all agree with me.  Enjoy!!"
"We use this marinade a lot in the summer - usually for grilling chicken. I also throw this in when making burgers and it is a hit. No weird ingredients, and I actually chose this item while at the grocery store, stuck in the marinade and bbq sauce aisle, looking for something, anything, that didn't contain high fructose corn syrup. Great taste and no scary ingredients."
I knew the product and liked it enough to order it online! It was the service and attention that really were outstanding. I highly recommend the sauce and the seller!
"I checked the label and the ingredients are good and no major fat content, cholesterol, carbs or sugar. The sauce has been used by us for several years and is good on any type of chicken, meat, fish, and makes it all taste very good.  Gives bland food an extra zip."
We have been using this marinade for 10 or more years now.  It is a favorite with all the members of our family as well as a few friends who have been treated to grilled meat marinated with MMM sauce.
"I have been taking amazing grass for about a year and I love it. I have seen my energy level increase as well as my immune system. I teach 2nd grade, therefore I am around kids all day long.I rarely get sick anymore. I also love it because I know I am getting all of my vegetable servings that I need. This is really outstanding grass!!"
"I love this stuff.  In the first week of taking it I immediately noticed a difference in my energy level.  Where before I'd be lagging at the office, now I can keep my sustained energy up without eating sugar or coffee. I swear by this stuff and am a loyal customer from here on out!  Thanks AMAZING GRASS.....<p>(p.s. I started off mixing it with juice, and now I mix it with just water to avoid the sugars. It's super delicious, taste like a naturally flavored juice)"
Most people know that a weakened immune system leaves an individual open to many different forms of disease. Superfood grass gives me an immune boost that makes me feel more balanced and healthier.  The individual packets are perfect for travel. Nancy
Hard to go back to standard salt after discovering the wonder that is fleur de sel. It makes everything taste better. The 35 oz container is a great deal. I bought wooden salt boxes and filled with the salt for a great Christmas gift which was appreciated by all. I filled 3 boxes plus my own which made it economical too.
"This is the ultimate finishing salt.  Use it and everyone will wonder what it is about your food that makes it so delicious.  You must swear, though, never tell!!"
"I already knew about this salt and had been using it.  It's a great ""finishing"" salt.  Sprinkle it on certain dishes just before serving.  It lends a little bit of ""bite of salt"" If you like the Godiva chocolate bar with sea salt, you'll understand what I mean. Great on tomatoes caprese, vegetables, crudites, salads - anything you want a little taste (bite) of salt.  It's flakey (kind of like Maldon) so doesn't dissolve as quickly, thus, the little ""bite""  Expensive enough that you reserve it strictly for finishing.  I eat raw radishes sprinkled with it while I'm preparing dinner.  This large size is very definitely the best buy.  The small 4 oz size sells for around $9 or $10 locally.  If you love to cook, this is a wonderful salt."
"This is a great finishing salt, it makes everything taste just a little better.  Great texture too.  This size is wonderful, and the price is right!"
"Good product, I have had better but for the price you can't beat it.  It makes a great finishing salt, don't waste it in the macaroni pot."
"This is a good product if you do not want to pay for the top of the line fleur du sel. The texture is more like salt chips than crystals, which leads me to think that there has been some processing to get the uniformity of color and size this product presents."
"It's a pretty good effort, considering it's one of Tracey's first workouts.  Greg Twombly produced it and Tracey should have stayed with him since her subsequent workouts have not as good production quality.This workout consists of 9 Step Routines.  Each routine is followed by a 2 minute intensity blast.  Tracey teaches TIFT(take it from the top), meaning that you repeat each routine after you've learned the next routine.What I enjoyed about this workout:*Tracey's style.  As a long-time Cathe fan, it's nice to have a different personality and style to follow.*The short step routines. They're a bit complex, especially routine 2 with the baby mambo, but they're over quickly.*The intensity blasts are tough!  They sneak up on you.What I didn't care for in this workout:*Tracey's voice is very loud and she appears to be yelling the instructions.  Maybe this is her natural teaching style, but it gets annoying.*The step routines aren't that intense.  I made them more intense by using 2 risers on each side of my step. Tracey and her crew are only using 1 riser on each side.All in all, a pretty good intermediate step workout, especially if you like somewhat complex choreography without a lot of breakdown."
I have been purchasing this soup from Big Lots in CO. Now they are having a tough time restocking it. Our family loves the soup. I substitute organic chicken stock for the water and add my own cooked chicken. I have made it for committee meetings and been asked for the recipe. I love ordering from Amazon.
"Cugino's chicken noodle soup is pretty tasty. I used to buy it at Safeway, but they don't carry it anymore so I'm going to order it from amazon from now on. I usually add more veggies to the soup in addition to the chicken to make it a thicker, meal-type soup. I would definitely recommend this soup - it's so good!"
"I decided to take a chance on these Cugino's items because my dad gave me one of the Garlic Schmarlic Dipz packages that he wasn't going to eat that he found after my mother passed away.  That started the ball rolling.  I broke down, visited their website and did a 'sampling' of the majority of their items and I was extremely pleased!!This soup is extremely easy to make, cook some chicken (I've done thigh pieces cooked over low heat on my stove with fresh garlic and I've also done the same with chicken breasts - actually liked the thighs better because they are more tender), shred/cut the drained chicken, add water and Cugino's package, following directions and cook and out comes a VERY tasty soup.Now, like all pre-packaged items, if you're watching your sodium intake, you probably should NOT be using any pre-packaged foods.  This is just common sense.Needless to say, I ended up buying a six-pack from here at Amazon because it saved me a few bucks, didn't have to get a large quantity for the free shipping and since my hubby enjoys eating soups 24/7 I did the subscribe & save to save a few more bucks!!If you're on the fence about trying this, give it a go!!  I honestly believe you'll be pleased with this product.  If you're hesitant, do like I did and visit their site first and pick up the items that you're interested in and/or their own little 4 and 5 sampler packs to help people out."
"Great soup, its like the adult version of cup-a-soup, great when you are sick.  Good flavor, especially if you use home cooked chicken or add in some real broth.  No overly powerful flavors that you don't want when you need to remedy a cold and not too salty.  Most stores have stopped carrying this brand, not sure why as its great, but Cugino's website has a list of stores that carry it.  Walley Wold Super Centers also seem to stock it at a great price if you just want one package."
"I was referred to this product by my father, I used to feel tired as the days go on due to my busy work and lot of computer seeing, but, after using this product, I feel so energetic and my mind is refresing, active and focussed till I go to bed and sleep.  I am able to focus and enjoy my work until the evening  Thanks to the great tea product.  Keeps me refreshed and energetic.I am so happy that my girl friend told me about this when I badly needed something like this to help me be active.  This product has the benefits of Moringa, Ginger and Tea. I used to feel heaviness and GASTRIC after my meals, now the ginger in this tea helps to soothen my stomach, clears the gas, helps for digestion whatever I eat. No more GASTRIC feeling.I have started buying their Ginger and Lemon Moringa Tea. Now, my whole hiking group have started using this product and we are happy to find this product."
"This tea is an excellent product for fighting fatigue.  It works right away.  The taste leaves a bit to be desired, but a little honey or agave goes a long way in getting past that problem."
"Great taste and just the correct amount of pepper! Had it delivered to my APO AE address in Iraq. The 3lb stick and the regular sliced salami as well. Shared with all, and saved some for me to enjoy later. Being an Italian, this was as good as a salami as I have ever had. Better than the salami I had in Rome too! Makes the mouth water and craving for it again now! Best to enjoy in moderation, it is a high sodium food, but oh so good and worth the guilty pleasure! Made some sandwiches too with spicy mustard! Only thing missing was sharp provolone cheese! That they won't deliver to an APO AE address, bummer. Enjoy and time for me to order some more!"
I'm very satisfied with this company. he order arrived sooner than expected. It was in excellent conditions. The product itself is delicious. I have ordered from them before and I have never been disappointed.
individually wrap sugar fruit bites is always fresh. I've ordered from them over two years and I have never been disappointed.
"I dont often write reviews, but I will have to say that I love this Salame.  I live in Virginia and you cannot find it here, but I order it and it ships from Sacremento, CA.  The shipping works fine, I never question if the product has gotten spoiled while in the mail as I get it quickly and I just have had no issues.  I will continue to order this...."
It is hard to find salame on line that is so good.  I live in the midwest and you can not find this product here anywhere.  I lived in San Francisco for 40 years and this was my choice of salames and still is.  Thanks for making Taylors Market available to purchase this great choice.
My four sisters and I fought over the one bag we got. So yummy! Can't describe it but a must try product :)
"I bought this for my fall wedding.  First, not much for the money.  Overpriced product, overpriced shipping.  Most of the shipping cost was probably for the useless gel pak to keep it cool, which didn't serve it's purpose.  Either the chocolate got too hot or its from last Fall.  It was a small bag of chocolates - a pound doesn't add up.  The chocolate was gray and somewhat deformed.  The texture is awful.  Grainy and powdery.  I will not use them for my guests.  I would be ashamed to serve it to them.  I will stick to cheaper and fresher M-n-M's."
These are all that i thought they would be i am using them in my fall themed wedding they are going on and around the tables for wedding favors......
"I would love to buy this as a Christmas present but I refuse to buy from places that overcharge on shipping. Oh well, I guess I will buy from a local shop."
"Yum...I really like these. Chewy (but not overly chewy..just right), caramely, chocolatey...in my opinion, a great substitute for a candy bar & a bit healthier, too. I always try to eat 1/2 a bar and save the other 1/2 for later, but they're just too good  - I eat the whole thing.I'd list the ingredients and nutrition information for you, but it is already included on the product page."
"We are really happy with the improvement in the new Keurig Vue system, however this is an area where they need to look at Tassimo. The cappuccino provided with the Vue is a 2 step system like the Tassimo, but it is a powder not a liquid. On several occassions, we had powder spill down into the cup before the water brewed. More importantly the taste does not compare to a real cappuccino or the quality in the Tassimo. Again, we are really happy with the Vue and will be keeping it, but if you are huge cappuccino fan you are going to be disappointed."
"If you enjoy a Gew&uuml;rztraminer that is true to its varietal strengths--floral nose, lychee and citrus flavors, with a bit of pear--AND you enjoy sweet wines, then this is a winner. If it has any weaknesses, they are in the relative lack of Gew&uuml;rztraminer spiciness and a slightly vegetal finish. Otherwise, this is a fine value in a white wine. Will pair nicely with fruit, desserts, and Asian foods. Or enjoy it alone."
"I ordered this candy with the expectation that it would be sour and tart. It was not sour at all, the candy looked stale and tasted very bland.  I will never order from this seller again, I feel I have wasted my money. After searching other candy sellers, I wish I would have done it before buying this candy.  I actually found it much cheaper at gumballmachines.com. I feel like I've been ripped off! Lesson learned."
"My dog just needs to see me shake the container of these treats, and she comes running to sit at my feet. She'll circle through all the tricks she knows in order to get one! They are a good small size, so I don't feel bad about giving them to her and ruining her appetite for her regular meals."
"This is a terrific treat. My dog loves them. They are a bit pricey, yet worth it as a special snack."
"Our puppy LOVES these.  As soon as she has one in her mouth, she runs to some comfy spot to chew on it.  We love these because they are just chicken and no chemicals."
"I love these chips..They are really different from the regular chips, only better..the only drawback is ...the quantity per bag is a little small...they should sell a lot more of these in bigger bags!!! I absolutely love them!!!!!"
These veggie chips taste great......fresh and crisp! BUT I am very disappointed in short expiration date.....12 bags arrived 8/31/09 and all expire 10/21/09. I really hadn't planned on plowing through these 12 bags in less than 8 weeks! It would be MOST helpful if expiration dates were included in product information! I purchase a wide variety of grocery items frequently and this is first time I have been disappointed. I do hope it will be the last time!
"These chips are quite literally a mixed bag.  If not for the yucca chips (I think it's the yuccas), this would be a solid 5 star bag of chips.  The problem with the yucca chips is that they are very hard and difficult to chew.  The reviewer below who complained of jaw problems after eating them was not off the mark.  I had minor jaw pain myself after eating them.  I am not sure why, but half to most of the bag consists of these undesired tooth killers.  They are also the chips with the least flavor out of the bunch, so I'm guessing they are also the cheapest to produce.  It's a shame, because the yuccas are really dragging this bag of chips down and keeping me from recommending it.  Get with it, Terra!"
"I have to admit trying these just out of simple curiosity. Yes, they are bright colored as the picture shows. The flavor is what has me hooked. As other reviewers have stated, each chip has its own and varied flavor. It turns a bag of traditional potato chips into boring by contrast. I am not much of a potato chip eater--but these are definitely a favorite. I love sharing them with friends, who are equally impressed with their unique textures and colors. Beisdes good eating, they are a great conversation piece. Not too salty. You truly savor each one. Enjoy."
"While the spice used is good, the chips themselves are too hard...the sweet potato was fine but the majority are like thin sheets of glass, which is not nice in the mouth...  I would not buy these again, just too hard..."
"Oh my goodness... I am NOT a chip kind of person, but these are the most amazing chips I have ever tasted in my life.  I have nothing of value to add to this review (you can't objectively rate a food product!!!) other than to rave over their taste.If you like a variety of root vegetables combined with a very fitting combination of spices... just try these.Yes, some of the chips are very HARD to chew, but come on people, use your common sense here:  soften them in your mouth longer, and savor the taste of the spices!  Only plain old boring potato chips can get away with being shoveled in your mouth.  But these are special chips!!I buy these at my local store, and I shamefully finish the small bag by the time I'm home.  They need to start selling them in bigger bags."
"I was skeptical of these because I do not have a taste for healthier food...but I am trying!  I didn't have to put any effort into liking these, they are wonderful!  I have no issues giving up regular chips up for these.  Everyone I have let try them like them...including my toddler!"
"I will say I like only SOME vegetables and this makes it easier for both myself and family to get more of or veggies into daily life, if not always on the dinner plate."
"I love Terra chips...when they are in the big bags from the store...I ordered these expecting the same quality and it wasn't. The chips in these small bags (which were perfect for my lunch bag) were stale and tasteless. Some of the chips were too stale to comfortably chew. I don't know if they are sitting around too long in a warehouse somewhere or they don't do well in small packages, but don't order these chips like this."
"These are indeed some of the best chips I've ever had, but there's a caveat. One of the types of chip in the bag is much harder than the rest, sometimes almost painfully hard if your teeth or gums catch it just right. It's the light, semi-translucent chip, the yuca I think. Anyway, this would be a 5-star product without a doubt if that chip was removed or replaced. The others though are worlds above any name-brand chips or potato chips out there. Another good thing is what it lacks; no artificial preservatives, no cholesterol, very little sodium and very little carbohydrates. They are certainly a welcome break from all the garbage sitting on store shelves, in taste and in health."
"I have always been a reluctant vegetable eater...until I discovered Terra chips!  I never knew veggies in chip form could be so tasty.  The plain is good but the Mediterranean flavor is my favorite.  Spicy, flavorful, crunchy but not too hard.  Not greasy, either.  The price on Amazon is substantially cheaper than grocery stores as well.  These aren't leaner than your typical potato chip but they are higher in fiber and overall nutritional value.  Try them...I am sure you will be hooked!"
"I get these in the big bags all the time and end up eating the whole bag between my daughter and me.  These are 1 oz servings so they are small but it's enough for a snack or with a sandwich.  These chips are very crunchy and made of weird veggies, not potatoes so if you don't like sweet potatoes, beets, and other weird root veggies you probably won't like them, but...everybody I know who has tried them like them!"
"I have always enjoyed 'Terra' exotic vegetable chips. I have tried their other chip products, however I prefer these because of the variety. If you enjoy this product, I recommend that you purchase it through Amazon so that you can purchase the 1 ounce packages at a reasonable price."
"These chips, which are made from different vegetables besides potatoes are great if you want a different type of potato chip.  However, don't be fooled like me into thinking they are a healthy snack-they are made the way regular potato chips are-fried in oil.  So, if you are not loooking for health food-you ought to try them."
"Great size and the price is decent compared to buying at my local grocery stores (they don't offer this small size, just the big bags).  My only complaint is there seems to be a lot of broken crumbs at the bottom of these compared to a big sized bag.  But they are yummy!"
"The only thing good about this product is the packaging.  The chips themselves are okay, not great.  Very crunchy, but about 50% of the chips in the bags are very hard to chew on.  They are as hard as rocks.  I bought 12 bags a few months ago and still have about 5 left.  For each bag, I can eat about 1/3 (those red and orange chips and taro are not too bad).  The rest of the bag is thrown away because those translucent chips are as hard as rock.  Maybe some people like this kind of chips.  Do yourselves a favor and try some at the grocery first before buying in bulk."
"These chips taste great, and they're extra crunchy.  I ordered mine on 9/2/09, and they arrived today with an expiration of 11/03/09, so I guess ya never know what you're gonna get. Personally, I love the ruby root and taro--they're so delicious and crunchy!"
"These chips are a favorite as an alternative to potato chips. A bit pricier but tasty. Surprisingly, not as healthy as one think, has quite a bit of fat content vis a vis potato chips. However, a great way to jazz up a party offering."
worse than all illegal substances - completely addictive... proof that God loves us! Ha! Seriously - best chip I ever had! yum yum yum...
We got hooked on these when we visited the Smithsonian museum in Washington Dc. They were serving them at a small cafe we ate at. Comparing these to potato chips is like comparing diamonds to river rocks.
"The last couple of months I've been buying the Terra Blue chips, in the small bags,  Which is such a good idea, I like the fact I know how many calories i am eating,  Well, Amazon was out of the Terra Blue so I thought I  would give these a try and I am glad I did, They're very good,  I like the variety of different chips in the bag, all which are yummy.  Very yummy,  And a super alternative to potato for those of us who are encouraged to rotate our foods,  I'll definitely be reordering these,  They're my favorite now,"
"Love these chips.  You're eating more of a variety, not just another potato chip.  My son has allergies to potatoes so these worked out great.  We both love them!!  No dyes or preservatives either."
"We love Terra chips and these are one of our fave flavors. A good alteranative to regular chips, they are also healthier for you. You also can't eat just one!"
"I thought I'd really found a great treat to eat, but all the bags in the case contained a lot of finely broken pieces, and the product is very greasy. Would not buy this again."
"These chips are truly unique. Naturally colored with beet juice, they are festive and great for entertaining. They are super crisp and thin - and not greasy at all. When you first bite into them, it's almost chocking - they're totally chewable, but stronger than typical chips - so when you first bite into one, it's like you're biting into thin glass - it's almost shocking - but good nonetheless. Tasty and light."
"I had some of these Terra chips for the first time a few weeks ago and was honestly surprised by how good they were! I have since tried the Original, Mediterranean, and Sweets and Beets flavors. I liked them all, so I'm looking forward to trying even more of the flavors in the future. There are a variety of root vegetable chips in each bag (varies based on what flavor you buy). I like all the veggie chips I've had, though some are harder than others. Terra chips have a great texture--crunchy like regular potato chips rather than soft and chewy like most dried fruits/veggies. This makes them a great alternative to chips with more nutritional value. I really like them and enjoy having them for a snack now and then. I like the Mediterranean flavor best out of the ones I've tried so far, but they are all really good."
Terra Exotic Vegetable Chips are the very best chips on the market. They have a good taste and are not greasy like so many similar products.
"These are the BEST of the line from Terra, but why are the zesty tomato missing from all stores? Why can't we find them anywhere? What is up?"
"I love these chips a whole lot! This is also a great deal for them on subscribe and save when I compared it to the normal price I pay per bag in the store. The chips are yummy and taste natural. Some are very crunchy and a little hard to bite so I would not recommend these for elderly individuals or people who need or prefer softer food. My only issue with these chips is that they seem a little salty. Most people I let try them kept commenting on the sodium level as well. I kinda love salt, and don't plan on giving it up too much right now, so they are great to me! The sodium is just a warning for those who are watching their intake to do their research."
"We buy a ton of the Terra brand veggie chips.  We absolutely love the Zesty Tomato flavor.  It is great.  It is super nice to have a whole pack of 12 lying around to munch on.  They came fresh and as described.  I think the pricing is similar to what you can get in the grocery stores, if you can find the flavor you like."
"These are the best! Nice crunch and nice flavors a little sweet, salty and crunchy. One bag equals one serving of vegies, not a bad way to get your vegies. I will continue to order these for sure. Price is good here on Amazon."
"These chips are wonderful, and come in cute little servings. I'm on a diet and find it a lot easier to moderate my consumption with smaller bags of chips. On top of that, they stay fresher, longer. The flavor is fantastic, especially if you are looking for something like potato chips but with a little more flair and flavor. Highly recommend."
We do not to go to grocery stores to purchase chips for lunch. The chips are always on time.  My family loves the fresh and nutritious snacks.
"These chips are very, very good. They are flavorful and crispy and some have a great texture. Some, not all. Unfortunately, about half of the chips are extremely hard to the point where no one in my house will eat them. They are so hard, it's almost impossible to crunch through them! It may have been a looming expiration date (I bought 12 of the large bags about three months ago) but as I noticed each new bag having more and more hard chips, I quickly gave them all away thinking that at least someone should enjoy them before they completely go bad because there was no way I would get around to eating that many by myself. So I can't check to see if that was the problem or not but after seeing how many reviews talk about this issue, I'm thinking it's pretty prevalent.My suggestion would be to find a single bag to purchase because while buying in bulk tends to be cheaper, you're just wasting money if you end up throwing a bunch away because it's gone stale.But other than the staleness, I LOVE these chips!"
I have ordered about 6 boxes (each with 12 6.8 ounce bags) from Amazon.  These are by far the best chips ever!  Just a little pricey though.
"I've been a fan of these chips for years. They have a unique combination of sweet potatoes, beets, yucca , taro, parsnips and batata which provide a different combination of crunch compared to plain old potato chips.  I notice the bags are now advertising that there is a full serving of vegetables in every ounce (I never noticed this claim before) but I wouldn't consider them that much healthier than other types of potato chips.What the unique combination of root vegetables do  provide is a variation of color, crunch and flavor. I'm not a fan of the hard red beets, after biting into one I've actually chipped a tooth but I do enjoy the rest.Mediterranean is my favorite, the flavor is outstanding as it's tangy, salty and slightly sweet.The Terra chips maybe junk food but they are up scale junk food with the variation of colors and ""exotic"" root vegetables and would fit in as perfectly as an appetizer at a social event as they do just straight out of the bag."
I think these chips are wonderful. I read that some people don't like the hard crunchy chips inside. (Yucca's) I'm just the opposite I guess. I couldn't love the hard crunchy bit's more. Their wonderful. I could do without the really soft stuff. I guess it's totally up to you to get them and try. I definitely would recommend these. I'd also buy these yucca chips in a bag all there own. That's how much I like them:)
"I like these! They are crispy and flavorful. Also, they are very colorful which any cook knows is important when preparing food for others. Place a bowl of these on the table at your next BBQ and just wait for the compliments. Read the nutrition information and compare it to your favorite potato chips and ask yourself why you would want to ingest all that junk when these chips taste just as good."
"These chips are delicious. I wish I paid more attention to the size - 1 oz bags, not quite as good a deal as I thought. I was looking for the big bags. This is my fault, and it is still a good deal, but I would be happier if they were the big bags. The snack size bags are convenient and neat though. It would also help if they did not expire so soon."
"These are great chips.  I buy the 24 pack and they are wonderful for lunches.  Every bag is a bit different and there is one chip I'm not crazy about (the white chip, parsnip maybe?), but there are never that many in any bag so it doesn't bother me.  My favorite is the sweet potato and the ruby taro.  All are crispy without being hard and only slightly salty.  You get the flavor of the vegetables and not just salt and grease like some chips.  Delicious."
These chips are delicious and healthier than a lot of other choices. I would love it if Amazon offered the ones with garlic flavoring; they're even tastier!
"Must be a typo, but these chips are NOT organic, or at least there is no official mention of it anywhere else other than on Amazon. Otherwise, these chips are great! A healthy option and my personal favorite."
"I absolutely love Terra chips.  I have ever since I tried them on a Jet Blue flight.  They have great vegetables that are low in carbohydrates and high in fiber.  The only downside to these is that the fat is on the high end of the scale.  Only 1 gram is saturated, but there are 9 grams total.They are delicious and great in moderation, but for an everyday snack I don't think so.  Something that has more than 50% of all calories derived from fat is not an everyday thing.  Maybe 1 or 2 times a week.  But if you are trying to watch your calories and want to indulge every once in a while. Great product!!!"
I just love Terra Chips. They are great for those of us who are looking for a healthy alternative to regular chips.
"WOW!!! Fast delivery  Excellent product..I had previously purchased these at my local market but alot of the chips were broken from handling.These were whole and such a variety of flavors.If you want a break from""Ho Hum"" Try these"
"It was tasty eating this all crumbled down and semi-dampened in a soup bowl :D.Just eat with some liquid, otherwise you will have tongue blisters"
"This product is excellent. Aside from Stacy's Pita Chips, this hits the spot. Delivery was quicker than expected. Price was very high relative to competing products, so I will probably not order this very often. Maybe splurge once a year"
"These chips are excellent.  I bought them to supplement my weight loss diet with vegetables, however.  I agree it is hard to put them down so if you are allowed only a 150 calorie snack or veggie serving on your diet you will need to have the restraint to measure out a quarter of a 4oz bag or about an 1/8th of these bigger bags and put the rest away.  They are soooo good though it's worth the try."
"We LOVE this product! The first day they arrived I ate two bags by myself! I ate them for lunch and dinner... that is how good they are! My husband was a bit taken aback that I had paid as much as I did for them, but once he tasted them he saw why and forgot all about the cost! These are perfect presentation wise for a get-together because of the color variety and texture; they look and taste good! I give them 5 thumbs up! Once you try them you'll be hooked too. A word to those with dentures or sensitive teeth; this may not be the chip for you because some of the chips are REALLY REALLY crunchy."
I Love these veggie chips. these chips are so full of flavor that you will not just pop whole chips in your mouth like regular potato chips. You will want to nibble on these and enjoy every little bite of them. They are also colorful and would look nice for serving guests. So Yummmmmmy! What a great treat. Each different veggie chip has it's own destinct flavor.Buy these to share.
These are really awesome!!! nutritious and much tastier than the traditional potato and corn crisps
"These Chips were amazing. Best chips I have had in a long time. They are kind of like the sweet bag of dried fruit you normally get to snack on, but these are vegetables. I got the Ala Mexican flavored kind and they are great. However, they are even better with salsa if you want more flavor. Great new chip to try."
"Tasty, healthy and fun! Unlike other chips(you get bored quickly), you can dig in the bag and pick different chips according your mood."
"How often do you eat a parsnip? Well, I don't make the opportunity very often, so I'm thrilled to see parsnips in my fancy black snack-chip bag. Vastly superior to corn or standard potato chips. No trans fats. Colorful, too. Delicious dipped in hummus. Made by a division of Hain, for you health-food business knowledge nuts."
"I FIRST BEGAN BUYING THESE CHIPS WHEN I WAS DATING MY HUSBAND, THAT WAS FOURTEEN YEARS AGO, WE CAME ACROSS THEM WHEN WE WERE VISITING A MUSEUM, EVER SINCE THEN I HAVE BEEN HOCKED, THE CHIPS ARE COLORFUL, AND BURSTING WITH FLAVER, THE ONLY DOWNSIDE IN MY EXPERIENCE IS IT DOESNT MATER WERE I PURCHASED THEM, ABOUT 15%-25% ARE REGULAR SIZED CHIPS, THEN THEY GET SMALLER AND SMALLER FROM THERE, PRETTY SOON I AM LEFT WITH A LARGE PILE OF CRUMBS!!! WHICH YES I EAT, BECASUSE THEY ARE YUMMY, IT SURE IS ANOYING AND FRUSTRATING, BECASUE OF THE AMOUNT OF CRUMBS AND THE SKY HIGH PRICE, {THE MOST EXPENSIVE CHIPS I HAVE EVER COME ACROSS.} I TRY NOT TO BUY THEM SO OFTEN ANYMORE, HENCE THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD RATING"
"I thought this one would be better than the blue potato that I tried 3 months ago as it has better review/rating, but it turned out to be a bad one. I am not sure if it became that hard to chew just because it is expiring in 1 month, but it hurt my teeth and jaw after finishing half of the first bag. My jaw became clicking sound and I had to see my doctor after eating this. I think three forth of the chips in each bag are those hard ones. Now, the remaining became the feeding food for the squirrels. Conclusion: 2 problems: (1) those 24 bags are expiring in one month; and (2) most of the chips are too hard to bite."
These chips are indeed tasty. But one of the main ingredients is canola oil. Unfortunately 93% of canola oil used in the US is genetically modified. [...] Unless the canola oil says it's organic it's GMO.
I didn't mind eating these chips but my kids were not fans of them...even my daughter who is not a picky eater.  Some were a bit tough.  We won't be buying these again.
These chips are not as good as the other Terra products I have tried.  They are too spicy to taste anything but spice and they also have a shape and texture that are not very good.
"These tasted nice, but I think they are too thick and ridiculously crunchy. We purchased these to snack on at work, but they made too much noise to eat politely in a cubicle. Also, I have TMJ, and I sometimes found them difficult to eat. But if that's not a problem for you, they are a tasty, healthier alternative to potato chips."
"1st , i buy a box , which is six or seven bags in it , i ate the whole box in days , went and i buy another box , ate 2 bags and the rest i gave to friend"
"I opened one of these terra chip bags and to my surprise, 6 crummy pieces of broken chips were in there. Not even 6 whole chips. 6 chip fragments. Plus, the chips looked totally stale. I returned the bag to the store immediately upon opening it."
"no visible package damage, As each bag was opened, small pieces of broken chips. Yes, they did taste okay to eat."
"Tried these the other day, put some in my mouth and some colors are so hard they are like rocks. Next thing I know, I had a broken molar and over $1000 in dental work. So buyer beware!!!!"
"The product is okay, but not nearly worth the price. Look for King Oscar or some of the more common brands of top quality sardines istead. I have no quarrel with these, but the price is simply way too high for we mere mortals."
excellent; but in all honesty not really noticeably 'better' than first class canned sardines that cost considerably less............king edward 'cross pack' /for the price/ hard to beat i think
"This is a very good natural product for helping with bloating, irregularity, and constipation.  It tastes great and works.  I was recently told about this product by a person who loves it.  I wish I knew about it before now!"
"Really like the tea, and it did cause moderate weight loss, however, it also caused intestinal upset which it said it wouldn't."
I used to eat Mounds when I was a kid. This box was delivered very fast and they were very fresh. I have already ordered another box. I recommend this item to anyone that likes fresh candy.
"i bought a pack of watermelon rolling papers and received a horrid rank smelling watermelon hookah molasses, this stuff smells like rancid watermelon and i had to leave it on the porch because it stunk up the whole house...in closing im not pleased with this business"
smells awesome tastes awesome.  what else can be said about that man?  Its not the cheapest but they last a while though.
"These are one of my favorites from Juicy Jays.  The paper quality, as always, is hands-down great, the flavor is exceptional, and I can't get over how cute the pattern is!"
"I wasn't expecting much smoking these, simply because I'd heard that flavored papers weren't so great. I would definitely not recommend these. Honestly, I didn't taste any of the watermelon at all, just bad rolling paper which made the ""herb"" taste very bad. The papers are also very thick which contributed to the bad burning."
These papers are my favorite flavored rolling paperthey are delicious when smoking any kind of herb;Dmy favorite and i 10000% recommend to any future buyers:)
"Hei, customer!! If you like fragmentatized chips, this is the product for you.If you like to eat chips with a small spoon? You can not miss any of those."
"MMmmm these are so delicious! If you like spicy chips, you have to try these. They are the only jalapeno flavored chips I've found thus far that actually leave you with pleasant ""burn."" I can't find them in stores anymore, so I was so glad to be able to buy a case online."
"Move over Pringles Cheddar Cheese, I have a new love! For the longest time (since I was five), cheddar cheese was my ultimate favorite Pringles flavor but eversince I tried jalape&ntilde;o, I've been hooked. I can't get enough of them. I don't mind having it every single day. It has the right amount of flavor- at least for me. This one is not too hot which means I can have as much as I want (my stomach gets upset with spicy stuff, btw). It's spicy enough for me plus it's very flavorful so I'm hoping they would never change one bit of ingredient. For those people who like it really spicy, I don't think this would even excite your taste buds though. If you want something flavorful that's a little bit hot, I would definitely recommend Pringles Jalape&ntilde;o!"
"Good service..Prompt and as advertised.  For smaller dogs as they don't last but a minute or two. And, at over a dollar a stick, your money would be better spent on longer lasting treats."
"i love this butter. it's better than regular butter and makes eggs or anything else taste great. Plus it's organic with higher levels of Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA). A must in every home, i think"
"My local pet supply store had By Nature on sale, as he'd gotten a special shipment. My dogs love all the favors and I especially like the teeth cleaning variety. Problem is, these are getting harder to find."
My whole family adores this dressing. It has a unique flavor while at the same time being pleasing to everyone (even the picky ones!)Soooo good!
"This is the best flavor of gum I have ever tried.  I wasn't even in the habit of chewing gum often, but this gum is making me into a habitual gum chewer.  I like it so much!  One thing that you should know about this flavor is that not everyone likes it.  Several of my family members don't like it much at all.  However, I think the flavor is amazing, and quake at the thought that they might discontinue it some day.  What would I do?  There's nothing even similar.  This gum freshens your breath, but it isn't as harsh as some of the other Eclipse minty flavors.  It's mildly spicy, but not quite as strong as most cinnamon gums, I would say.  It does have a pleasant sweet spicy flavor that lasts and lasts.  In fact, one odd (but in my mind, wonderful) thing about this flavor is that it actually gets stronger as you chew it longer!  I don't know how they did that.  It contains cardamom (a spice used in gingerbread and also in Indian curries).Please try it!  I'm desperate for you to try it and like it.  We've got to get more people buying this gum so that the flavor is never discontinued."
"Just a quick note to say that if you enjoy the flavor of cardamom at all, you will love this gum! Long lasting, true breath freshening ability, great flavor. All I need in a mint gum."
"Eclipse Breeze Exotic Mint chewing gum is, by far, the best breath freshening sugar free gum I have tried. Unlike other gums where you need multiple pieces to get any noticeable effects, one piece of this gum is enough to leave your mouth feeling cool and clean. The cardamom flavor is fairly strong, so that might make a difference to how much you like this gum (my parents used cardamom a lot, so I like the taste).My only minor complaint is that the gum becomes somewhat ""stringy"" after chewing it for a long time, and since the flavor really does last a long time, it almost always happens.This is a really good, long lasting gum!Highly RecommendedCFH"
"This was exactly what I needed at the price I wanted. I was very pleased with the entire process. Easy to purchase, smooth transaction, fast shipping and a good company. I will purchase from this vendor again on a regular basis."
"I'm a gourmet cook that doesn't like American food because it's bland.Cardamon is excellent in stews, & better yet in this gum.This gum rocks!It keeps me awake when driving.What's not to like?"
"""Eclipse Breeze Exotic Berry"" gum is surprisingly unpleasant tasting as the cardamom and berry flavors do not go together! I bought this flavor after trying <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002Q9ZX8C"">Eclipse breeze exotic mint sugar free chewing gum - 12/pack, 12 ea</a> (which is very good ""*****"") and was very disappointed. Just to be sure that it wasn't only me, my kids tried it as well and they both found it to be ""gross"".The only real upside of this sugarfree gum is that after the berry flavor goes away, the cardamom does do a good job freshening your breath.Not Recommended!CFH"
Many of these peppermint gums make me look like I'm chewing lemons...all in the pursuit of fresh breath!  I trusted the reviews and was not disappointed.  Wonderful flavor and that cardamom added a pleasant twist.  I'm hooked and so are my teenagers.
This gum completes me. Unfortunately I havent been able to find it in stores in my area anymore :/ so happy to have found it and buy by the case here on amazon!
"I have a serious addiction to this gum but cannot find it anywhere except online. I go through at least a pack a day. I used to chew Peppermint or Spearmint or Winterfrost but I can't chew anything but Exotic Mint any more. The flavor is just right and it lasts forever.Seriously, if you see this gum in a store, buy all of it. It's like little candy gold bullion. I have opted to pay twice as much online for this gum versus gum I can buy on the store shelves just so I can get this particular flavor. Who would do that if the gum weren't the best gum ever? Nobody. That's who.I also wrote Wrigley to see if they'll send me a year-supply for free. Cross your fingers and wish me luck."
I just like this flavor a lot.  I can't find it in the stores anymore.  I think others must not appreciate it.  I can't stand the mint flavors.  They're just too strong for me.  This is a nice fruity flavor.  And it's great on freshening up your breath without those strong minty flavors.
"I have loved this gum since the first time I tried it!!!  The cardamom in it reminded me of my grandmother's hot cross buns....it is a different spice, but I am glad you found it and used it in this gum....If I could I would buy cases and cases of it!"
"The Exotic Mint flavor is a really nice change of pace. It is very mellow, yet freshening - not the super sharp, almost burning minty burst that quickly fades, that you'll find with most gums. The cardamom works very well with the mild mint flavor, but ""berry cardamom"" sounds like a terrible idea. No thank you!"
This is a great tasting gum. It has cardamom an expensive spice which gives it a great flavor. It has a great taste. I hope they do not discontinue making this. There is no need to mix this with mint. Cardamom flavor by itself would have been better.
"This is not your typical flavored mint or fruit gum, thank goodness!It's got a taste of cardamon with a bit of a berry flavor, and bringsmemories of Indian or Middle Eastern spices and flavors. Thanks, Eclipse,for continuing to bring us great new flavors :) :)"
this gum tastes horrible - there's nothing exotic about it unless you define exotic as tasting like chemicals and plastic
This is THE most expense price for this wonderful gum I have ever seen!!! You can get it three times cheaper at Target!!
"Well, of course the fruit snacks themselves are delicious, but I thought I was getting a bulk package, as in 5 boxes of Annie's fruit snacks!!!  It's a good thing I bought this item when it was on sale, because if I payed the regular price of $16.55 for one box I would be really mad...."
"I have been drinking Choice tea for many years and have always been happy with their teas in a tea bag.  However, after seeing this, I was intrigued so ordered some!  I'm sure that the pyramid helps to make this a great tasting tea.  A little expensive but well worth the extra.  I can recommend this product without hesitation."
"I'm extremely picky when it comes to coffe flavor, but I loved this frappe blend. The coffee flavor isn't overwhelming or bitter. I was a little nervous buying it in such a large bulk, but it the cost isn't as bad when you break it down by serving. I'm happy I finally found an organic frappe that tastes good."
"NALLEY CHILE CON CARNE REVIEW on AMAZON.COMAs a child, I was brought up eating this FABULOUS tasting brand of Chili Con Carne. The ""ORIGINAL"" flavor is still the best, in my opinion. There is NO better brand of Chili Con Carne, than ""NALLEY"", that I have been able to find and I've tried pretty much everyone available. Try it on two (2) pieces of toasted, 100% whole wheat bread...heavily buttered OR using Imperial Margarine non-hydrogenated choice. Then, cut it into NINE (9) pieces for each one of two (2) pieces of toast...to make it last longer. Mmmmmm!!!  You'll be even more pleased that you have read this little so called review, if you try this suggestion, along with the more important suggestion found below.One person can make the contents of a (40) oz can, last for four (4) meal servings, if one is concerned about the HIGH salt or sodium content and/or the weight gain from too many calories.  Ten (10) oz on two (2) pieces of toast is more than enough. This is also a GREAT source of protein, in ones diet.Did you know that a high protein diet, from BEEF or any other RED meat source, is the MAIN cause of cancer cell overgrowth in human body tissues??? Something we call ""CANCER"" and keep wondering why the horrible and extremely sad true stories are becoming more and more difficult to listen to and worse to experience...which we have unfortunately experienced in our family...too many times over and over. Just to mention a few, a Mother-in Law, a Sister-in-law, several aunts and uncles, a few friends and then, the very worst of all, my very dear darling wifey, at age (57) years young. There wasn't anything that I have been taught and learned over the years and years that could save any of the above...you see, they would NOT listen to the ""RED MEAT PROTEIN FACTS"", that I've taken the time to try to help you with...above. Am I listening myself? It's NOT 100% yet but I am almost there but a ways to go myself. :o) I tell you that to be honest and try to show you that I am NOT trying to condemn anyone but ONLY to help the ones that will heed the above and hopefully ONLY die of an old age but a healthy old age full of everything we all could have if we only would listen and in some cases, even knew more of what we are doing that is making us ill and causing premature death. :o)This is the VERY BEST reason, I can think of, why we should eat more things like the kidney bean source of protein found in this extremely fine product call Nalley Original Chili Con Carne with Beans. :o)  Unless one is allergic to legumes or the beans found in this product, or some other GOOD reason, may I please suggest than no one wastes their time eating ""CHILI"" without the beans.

"there are a variety of ginseng coffee packets out in the market, and basically they all taste quite good.  the difference between gold choice and other brands, is gold choice lists instant coffee and ginseng as the first two ingredients and sugar last.  the other brands list sugar first, coffee creamer, coffee and ginseng last.  you do get a good energy boost from these coffees, but i've always wondered how much of it is from the ginseng or the sugar.  i will stick with this gold choice brand ginseng coffee for all future refills."
"We first tasted ginseng coffee on a vacation in Italy last year. Unable to find it in stores where we live, it finally dawned on me to check on Amazon. Gold Choice looked like a good choice, so I ordered three lbs as a Christmasgift for my husband. It arrived on time, and this instant coffee product tastes exactly as we remembered. Full bodied, rich flavor and aroma make it an absolutely delicious special treat. Good mail order service. We'll be ordering here again very soon. Highly recommended."
"I'm not a coffee lover, but I can drink this delicious and comforting ginseng coffee.  My coffee drinker friends LOVE the taste and convenience of a packet for the ""perfect cup"" of a healthy and satisfying beverage."
"I like the taste of this coffee package plus the convience of using it.  I would recommend it to anybody who travels a lot and want cream and sugar in their coffee, much better than hotel coffee."
"I love this product, it tastes almost the same as the ginseng coffee you can find in Italy; I add milk instead of hot water and it's just perfect!!!"
Look on the dog alert e-mails. Apparently bunches of dogs have gotten sick and died from this product and others made by this company but not enough for the regulatng entity to officially pull this item from the shelves. Many many dogs have died and gotten sick. I had just purchased two  big bags and threw out the bags so I couldn't take them back to the store so I just threw out the chicken strips in the garbage better than my golden getting sick. Everyone should get those doggy alerts for BAD food.
"With Subscribe-n-Save and Prime I'm saving so much over buying ""natural"" or organic canned beans and veggies at my local Walmart.  Very good quality product."
"The kidney beans and black beans by Libby seem more like home canned than some of the others, which makes them taste better....like the black beans most of the cans had quite a bit of juice...a few more beans could give this a 5 star!This shipment came through o.k. and was thankful they also were stamped product of USA.I ordered two more cases and there were several cans damaged in that shipment.  One the lids had swelled and I do not think it will be safe to use. Maybe Amazaon resolves this issue, I've not had much experience in that line."
As a pescetarian I use kidney bean quite a bit for cooking. And especially for Four Bean Salad. I have tried other brands but the Libby's Organic is fairly fresh tasting for a canned product.
"Kidney beans are an excellent choice, nutritionally. Finding the organic variety delivered to my door at a great price is darn near miraculous!Cool beans!"
"Libby's makes a surprisingly good can of beans, but they do not use bpa free cans. If you are buying organic, then you are avoiding pesticides and herbicides, so you probably don't want bpa either. Unfortunately, most cans aren't bpa free. So its either bpa or boil your own beans."
"This item was exactly what i expected! It comes a little strong at first, but once you get used to, is a delightful cup to chill around... Thank you!"
"NOTE from the Package: Official Instructions for Bar Consumption by the King of Hearts""Begin at the beginning and go on till you come to the end: THEN STOP!""This is a fun little novelty item for Alice in Wonderland fans. The outside of the package contains quotes, riddles, brainteasers, and trivia related to the classic story. The bar code on the bottom seems to suggest a ""Cheshire Cat"" smile, which is a clever marketing touch. Inside of the package, a tasty Fruit & Nut Energy bar can be found. The""Food for Thought"" Energy bar, with hearty bits, has a full, rich flavor. It's hard to describe, but it something akin to a fruit cake or granola texture. It's rather sweet and chewy, but in a satisfying way.I give four stars because I wanted a bigger bar or other feature for the price. (It's a novelty item though, so this is probably why the price.:) However, I would buy it again with no worries as a special treat because I did like the taste, and you have to laugh at a food that boldly demands: ""Eat me!"" LOL So, I'm hoping that this product will be available for a long time!Safety Recommendation: people who have special diets, dietary limitations, or food allergies should carefully check the current ingredients list and contents before purchasing / consuming. You can contact The Unemployed Philosophers Guild for more information and / or check out their website."
"I thought this would have a mild honey flavor, with a hint of chokecherry taste.  The taste wasn't mild at all.  The honey was much too sweet, and the chokecherry too strong, for my taste."
"What I would call classic pumpernickel bread.  Great taste, excellent source of fiber and very filling.  The slices are long enough to split into two pieces and make a good size sandwich with only one slice."
"Not for the faint of heart, but this is the best pumpernickel bread I have had. It pan fries nicely in butter and becomes sweet if you do it properly, but can also toast quite well on its own. Very fibrous and wholesome; nothing like typical wheat bread and should not be expected to be as such.Sometimes a bit cracked, but pumpernickel is not expected to be strong and pliable. It'll break on you when you eat it; just part of the process. A very good deal on the whole, certainly the best price I've found."
"A crumbly, nutty pumpernickel.  The bread holds together enough for a sandwich, but it is probably best for cheeses and spreads.  It is good, but it is not my cup of tea:  3.5 stars to be exact."
"I cut a slice into four equal parts, then I put a little butter oneach one and pop in to microwave for 30-40 seconds, thensprinkle with a little salt.  Eat with tea or some other drink."
"I love the simplicity of this bread and its wholesome goodness.  Not too many ingredients.  I usually eat mine toasted with some peanut butter, but it's also good with jam or cheese melted on top."
"This bread is delicious and very good for you too. Unlike most American breads you get in your grocery store, this bread has no sugar added and isn't super sweet. It's made of only whole grains and is loaded with fiber (6 grams/slice). I use it mostly for sandwiches, and it is great with lox!"
"I eat this bread every day, and I like it every day. Very good pumpernickel flavor, though probably not the absolute best. Very nutritious, hardly anything bad in it (but not gluten free). Only 1g fat and 1g sugar in a 68g slice, compared to 4g protein. Twice as much protein as sugar and fat combined. Very nice with something on it, plain, or toasted. Made in Germany."
"My neighbor & I ordered a case of this bread.  She had never eaten this before lol.  She gave her half to me. lol  This is a wonderful bread, but it's for hard core bread lovers of pumpernickel.  Today life is all about eating healthy foods.  This bread helps to fullfill that area of my life.  I have a bread machine that I use to make 100% stone ground whole wheat bread.  I keep this bread in my freezer for a quick snack.  I like this bread with melted sharp chedar cheese.... &lt;3"
"My husband loves this bread!  He is from nothern Germany and prefers the dark breads over the lighter.  I ordered this for a Christmas present for him and he was elated to have 12 packs of this bread. He eats it with butter on it, or cheese, or meats - or all 3 at the same time.I enjoy this bread as well for a sandwich that is not overly thick because of the bread.  It has a good pump taste, not too strong and not so light you have to guess what type of bread you are eating."
"This is the best pumpernickel bread around. I first purchased a single loaf in a specialty store.The taste is unlike the normal pumpernickel breads from regular grocery stores or bakeries because this one contains NO WHEAT FLOUR. The first ingredient on other rye breads is wheat flour. This rye bread only uses whole kernel rye and rye flour.So it does have a stronger taste, nutty and rich. I am so sold on this product."
"Great tasting, especially toasted. Expiration date stamped on the package is about 10 months from the time I received it. Made in Germany, the country where pumpernickel bread originated.No chemicals are listed on the ingredients label unlike the abomination pumpernickel bread sold in US bakeries which has half of the periodic table of elements on the ingredients list and is colored with caramel/molasses/cocoa, etc. US-made imitation is total garbage compared with this real pumpernickel bread and cost more.This bread is a rare example of the real thing which is better quality and costs less than the imitation.I will gladly buy it again when my supply runs out."
This is our fourth order and as always fast delivery even with the free shipping..  Fresh and very good..  Just store them in the freezer till needed..
"this is the only kind of seasoning I use for my soy tacos.  I stopped buying the Del Taco flavoring when I read that it contains msg.  Just to give you an idea of my tastes, I loved the del taco seasonings, so Simply Organic is a great alternative that tastes just as good, without the side effects of msg."
"I love Tex-Mex food, but haven't made tacos at home in a while for lack of being able to find ""non-chemical"" taco mix. This mix has a good taste (I've had my share of organic food that was much too bland for me) and is easy to use.  If you want super spicy, you may have to add a little more cayenne.For those of you like me who always need reminders of things to fix, don't forget yummy taco salads!!! ... or other dishes that might be good with seasoned meat added to it.I haven't tried it yet on tofu - for you non-meat eaters - but, I think I'll try it next! Mmmmmm."
"I was afraid buying 12 of a product I never tried before, but I was glad I did.  I have been really pleased with all the Simply Organic Products I have tried.  Pleasant flavor.  Whole family liked the tacos we made with it."
"I was worried this would taste SO different than the Old El Paso or Ortega mixes that you get at the grocery store, but they don't, they taste almost the same and same coloring. But these are a little spicier so I'm going to use less than one pack per lb of meat next time. But YEY! No MSG! Tastes great! Kids don't notice difference!"
These packets are easy to throw in to anything to instantly turn it in to having a mexican food vibe. I love that it's organic too.
"We love the taste of this taco seasoning, it has just the right amount of kick to it; it's not too spicy, it's just right. :)"
"We stopped using grocery store coffee years ago. Now we only drink the espresso type coffee which we order on-line. When we ran out this weekend, I knew we'd have to pick up some coffee at the store until our shipment arrived from Amazon. My husband went to Walmart and ended up paying $17 for a pound of Millstone. I nearly fell over. The fab folks at Coffee Bean Direct got this order on Sunday, shipped it Monday & it was here on Tuesday. Plus we get 5 lbs of the best coffee for less than $32 on the subscribe & save program with free freight. How great it that? LOVE THIS COFFEE and the program and Coffee Bean Direct."
"Overall i love ordering coffee on amazon, b/c of the price quality and selection.  these were good beans, but not the best; the transaction was of course smooth and the item arrived on time.  If you are looking to brew coffee w/ espresso beans this makes a good cup of coffee however i was not as impressed with it when put to the crunch of espresso making."
"Pretty good flavor for some cheapy coffee. I expected much worse taste, but I'm pleasantly surprised. I do wish the bag was re-sealable, but it's ok.  We just had to transfer to big tupperware."
"A recently deceased friend told me about this food, Canadae Platinum.  He fed his ""boys"" both the dry and the canned.  His boys are a German Spitz and a Bichon Frise, 4/14 years old respectively.  Doug said that after less than two weeks, the 14 year old was like a ""new dog"".I now have his dogs, fullfilling a promise, added to our Doxy and Shiba Inu ( 5/7 years respectively), three cats and 7 birds.  All the dogs are now on this Canadae Platinum dry food and love it.  While they used to pick at their old food, they dive into this.  They also seem to get satiated faster, so they actually leave a little in the bowls.The Glucosamine/Chondroitin is the key for the older dog.  A vet once recommended it for an older dog we used to have years ago.  When I started taking it for my arthritic ankles, I was soon able to stop taking anti-inflamatories like Daypro.  I've since found out that the medical establishment considers GC to be useless.  All I can say is that it works for me, and within a few weeks of re-starting Little Boy ( the 14 year old) on this food with GC, he runs, plays and jumps with the rest of the dogs like a puppy.There are a few places in Las Vegas selling this food, all ""high-end"" pet food stores and all slightly more expensive.  The convenience of one-click and having the food on my doorstep in a day or two is even better than the savings.We've also moved our cats over to Felidae (the feline version of Canadae) with similar results."
"My dogs are really happy with this food and I'm extremely pleased with the ingredients list. Fortunately, it does not give them the stinky gas that several other high quality dog foods have caused."
"This product is premium dog food at a moderate price & amazon delivers to my door-no lugging cases around,same price as my local feed store without the tax. My Vet recommended this dog food along w/2 others ,all my dogs are seniors so i use this & all 3 doing well on it.Highly recommend,use the dry food with this."
"We actually received the product in just a couple of days, BEFORE the anticipated arrival date.  It came in perfect condition, and was priced about the same as when we buy this product in the store.  It's very convenient to have it delivered to your door, especially when you live in a rural area and have to make a special trip to purchase the product.My vet recommended this dog food for our dog.  Our dog seems to like it as well as any other dog food out there.  He needs a good quality dog food because of his health and weight issues (he just had an amputation, due to cancer).I'm satisfied with the product and service."
"We were researching for a good, reasonably priced food to feed our dogs.Our senior dog developed diabetes last year and very quickly went blind.We needed to switch them off Nutro, which they had been on for many years.We were looking for something both our dogs would eat, with good ingredients. (Doberman and Doberman mix)Our diabetic dog loves it and her levels stay within range while on this food.It's great having this delivered directly to our door!"
"This really wholesome dry dog food has been great for my slightly chunky Mini American Eskimo.  She absolutely LOVES this food more than anything else I've ever fed her. She even likes a couple pieces of kibble as a treat.  Check out the ingredients and you'll see there are no Corn products which, while being rich in protein and carbs, is also pretty fatty and is much cheaper to use.  I think you'll be pleased with your results with this food."
"I've been feeding my dogs Canidae foods for over 10 years.  I partially attribute their longevity to a great diet and regular exercise.  I had some problems in the past when it appeared that Canidae reformulated this particular food and I ended up switching to another brand.  I was never happy with the other brand, and after about a year off from Canidae, I gave them another try.  The food was back to the former formula and my dogs loved it (and still do).  I'm happy that this senior formula has Glucosamine as a supplement.  Overall, aside from the reformulation issue, I'm a happy Canidae customer and my dogs are happy Canidae dogs!"
"I have a 8 year old overweight Bichon Frise... he's a full 28 lbs! I just started him on this food about 2 weeks ago, and I already see a difference. People have commented that he has lost weight and I notice increased energy.  I also notice that he is not as hungry as he normally is.  So far, so good with this food. And, super convienent that it is dropped off at your front door!"
We have multiple age dogs in our home. This food feeds a multiple age range and body types of dogs. It has no by products and it is wheat and corn free. The dogs do not get gas anymore!
"My overweight pug would rather eat the fuzz off the carpet then eat this food. I think this is the best diet plan for her. She drinks more water now, uses a ton of energy searching for different food and the dog food supply lasts longer. We all win!!"
"Because of the price, I decided to only feed this to my oldest (and only overweight) dog (out of 3 dogs).  She looks so good and still has a lot of youth and energy.  I adopted all of them, but I believe she is about 11.  I haven't weighed her, but she has visibly lost weight after 2/3 of the bag!  I'm guessing she has gone from 90 to 85 pounds in about 3 weeks, which is incredible.  I read a lot of good things online about the ingredients of this and a few other premium foods.  We will certainly continue with this if we can afford it; it's actually a great value if you have Prime; which is worth it if you're going to be ordering heavy items such as this."
This is  great dog food! It's been four weeks and my dog's coat is shinier. He's also slimmed down. It's pricey but worth it!!
"Ok, to be fair LadyBug likes anything edible.  :)  Which was part of the problem....  Lady is a older (11-14 yr.) std. American Eskimo who loves to  eat that I inherited from my Grandmother.  She got up to 42 lbs on her previous diet dog food and the vet wants her to be 35.  That means she was overweight by 20%  &lt;cringe>.  So I discovered this food and after &lt;6 months, she is 36 lbs.  She likes the food and once she adjusted to the smaller quantity of food, found it to be quite filling.  Our Bear (6 yr. Great Pyrenees / Border Collie mix) sometimes steals Lady's food instead of eating her own.  I'll probably move Bear over to this dog food next year.  I should probably note that as old as Lady is, she acts like a young dog...  even though she is losing her sight slowly."
"Yummy, yummy!This curry paste is now my favorite. It is easy to use, store, and best of all it is delicious! Pataks Curry is very mild....not super spicy like many others. My husband likes flavor and a little spice so this is his favorite as well. I can use the one jar for about 4 meals which is a great deal.I have found that is it so simple to make a ""stir-fry"" with a protein like tofu, chicken or even salmon and then add veggies such as carrots, or potatoes. There are many combinations and just about any typical veggie taste great in this sauce (love cauliflower). I think it is best kept simple with 2 or 3 ingredients.This sauce is great for an easy meal with guests, throw the rice in the steamer, make the curry stir-fry, and add another side dish and you are set. Our friends love it!Pataks also makes other great sauces but this is my favorite to keep on hand at all times."
"This is my favorite curry paste, but many groceries only stock the hot version, which has different spices and a different taste. I am glad I could get this online."
"I bought this and a grinder (and a couple other varieties of course salts) as a gift for my spouse at Christmas.  I know he enjoys the visual appeal of the coarse ground salt and I was tired of buying the $2.99 use-and-toss grinders of salt at the grocery store.As far as this salt goes, you should NOT use it in a grinder because it is too moist.  I did not know this until after I had purchased it.  I still use it as a finishing salt, but for the use I had in mind, grinding on food, it does not work."
"These are absolutely wonderful, and even better fresh out of the oven with low carb vanilla ice cream!  Almost as good the day after, but don't heat up.  The microwave cooks the cupcakes too hard and you loose the gooey chocolate center."
These taste like they have nuts in the cake.  Flavor is ok but overall they are not great.
"I wanted to try new flavors, so here is my experience:1. Lemon Lift - lemon taste is too weak and i don't care for the spices they've added. I wish it had more of ""clear"" taste of lemons.2. Green Tea - not bad for decaffeinated, but you have to love the taste of green tea to fully enjoy it.3. Constant Comment - i wanted to love it but... sorry... it's not for my liking. The orange flavor is very nice but the spices are odd, almost smoky and salty tasting?4. Earl Grey - excellent as usual. My first ""Bigelow love"".5. French Vanilla - was the main reason for buying this assortment. Excellent flavor! Sweet and strong aroma, very satisfying tea.6. English Teatime - nice, bold. Good as far as plain black tea goes.Conclusion - next time I won't buy this set, but only Earl Grey and the French Vanilla separately."
We moved to a lakehome that's a bit far away from good grocery stores. Thus able to order from Amazon of special food products at a very competitive price is a very very good thing. Thank you Amazon.
Sent this item as a gift to my newly expecting son and wife. They loved the idea of a selection of decaffeinated teas.
"If you like to have a variety of actual Decaf. teas (not herbals), but have to hunt up and down the grocery aisles just to find 1 or 2 (on a good day), this is a very convenient, economical way to go. Also, you don't have to scrummage through 6 or 7 boxes in your kitchen cabinet for a particular flavor each time. Each box contains 3 bags of 6 different flavors, all individually sealed. The rest of the 6 boxes in your order can be stored somewhere in the back of your cabinet and pulled out one after the other. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRLW"">Bigelow Decaffeinated Assorted Teas, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GFYRLW"">Bigelow Decaffeinated Assorted Teas, 18-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>"
"This is a great assortment to give as a gift or have in an office because it has a variety of Bigelow flavors, including classics like Earl Gray and Constant Comment and the milder Green and Lemon Lift teas.  It's great that all of these teas are decaffeinated!"
"I love tea and variety.  Being caffeine sensitive, I love I now have a variety option.  This tea is very good and I can have a different flavor 6 days of the week for three weeks per box.  With 6 boxes that's 18 weeks of tea."
"This assortment of decaf tea is a delight I look forward to in the evening.  The flavors are especially refreshing and varied.  My mood dictates which one I select!  I've ordered it before, and I'll order it again by the case."
"My 10-yr old Pom has had one greenie per day for several years, as recommended by vet for dental purposes.  She loves them, and there's never been any problems.  Great product!"
"Greenies are the house crowd pleaser...my westie, who is NOT food oriented, will pull out every trick in her repertoire before I can ask to get one of these. My lab starts to drool when he sees one. My shihvanese practically does back flips! Everyone loves greenies. I like how they leave my dogs' breath sweet smelling and teeth clean. Easily digestible, senior formulas with joint help, great on their digestive system, just a great, great product! Can't recommend it enough.I will say though...if your dog is a gulper, please make sure you watch them while they eat/chew. They seem to like it so much that you really need to be on hand just in case, as is true with any chewy product for your furkids!"
Product was as expected and delivered as indicated. Would definitely buy through Amazon again. Price very competitive.
"My reaction was ""wow!"" the first time I gave these to my 8 year old lab.  His teeth were extremely dirty with what seemed like plaque or whatever it was on his teeth that I could not get rid of by brushing his teeth.  I thought I would need the vet to professionally clean his teeth.  I was amazed as to how his teeth became pearly white after a few of these greenies not to mention that his breath did not have a nasty smell either.  I give these to my 2 year old pup as well.  Her teeth have never been as dirty as my 8 year old's but at least her breath is fresher too.5 STARS ALL THE WAY!"
"My dog loves these. I say ""you want a Greeeen-eees?"" and he comes running and sits obediently. He then proceeds to chew and inhale the treat immediately. I have a daschund-beagle mix, about 40 pounds so I purchased the medium sized treats to prevent choking based on previous reviews."
Good dog biscuit.  It is the treat she gets when we have to leave her home alone for a little while.  She knows a Greenie means we are going and will be back soon.  She takes it to her favorite mat and doesn't seem to mind that we are leaving.  I feel it is better quality than a lot of dog treats.
"Keeps my dog entertained as well as not so smelly.My dog always wants to eat the cat treats I feed our cat, so I got her some Greenies too.She likes to play with them as well as eat them.They are like an edible chew toy for her.A nice treat!"
brandi loves these greenies i mean shes crazy about these greenies i try to buy than when i can i do surveys online and i get amazon certificates for doing the surveys not all the time but some of the time and thats how i spend them on my brandi not on my self!! brandi has me trained but i have to say that after brandi using these greenies a few months i can see the difference in the teeth and gums shes doesnt have too much of that horriable  plaque and tartar like she had before and why because the greenies clean the tartar and plaque off of the teeth!this is a great product and if you care about your dogs health you will buy this product and why beacause it works~!!!!!
"My dogs don't have terribly stinky breath and I have Greenies to thank for it. I've tried the knock-off products and to be honest they don't seem as well made, plus  my dogs actually seem less excited about them.I ended up buying the large Greenies (pkg of 8) for two reasons. One, the price-point seemed right and two, I have two dogs (60+ lb catahoula leopard dog and a 10 lb terrier mix) and its easy to break the large Greenie into two portions for them. One packages last us about 1 month (1-2 Greenies / week).Our dogs really do love these things. If we present them with the option of a Greenie versus some other treat (say a bone) they invariably take the Greenie."
It arrived fast and it was priced really good. This is the first time I've tried them but my friends dog has used them since she was a pup and her teeth are so white and healthy! Can't wait till my puppy gets older and I see how good they worked.
"Whatever it is, Mo just loves it.  His favorite of all his treats.  Just a perk that it helps keep his teeth clean."
Of course dogs love Greenies!  I was happy to find I could get them right from Amazon since I live in a remote area.
The GREENIES are loved by all my Maltese dogs. In Germany they cost over 50% more. So I order them here and my dogs like to say thank you for the great treats.
"This product, I love !!  However, the product pictured on Amazon showed a package of 12 Large Greenies for $14.99 and what arrived was a package of 8.  That price I can beat at several of my pet stores.  I had ordered 3 packages based on the 12 Large/$14.99 and since they weren't as advertised, sent all 3 back."
"1.0 out of 5 stars Dangerous and Deadly, May 25, 2006I have two beagles who love to chew, and greenies are highly compressed which woule make it a good optionfor my dogs. However because they are so highly compressed they are deadly. There is an overwhelming amount of research that proves they are not digestible, and do not break down. Numerous dogs have died from chocking and internal blockages. Luckily this was brought to my attention before I purchased any.It really doesn't matter how much your dogs like them, statistically you dog would have an excellent chance of becoming seriously injured or worse.If keeping your dog busy is the goal try a kong or a ""busy ball"". My dogs play with their kong and similar toys for hours or until they are too tired to play anymore. Additionally some busy balls let you record a message that is played when the ball is moved, even slightly, which also helps with separation anxiety.If you want to treat your dog to something in the way of food, almost anything you can think of is safer than a greenie.Also please note....there are many greenie knockoffs. If the treat is shaped and molded or looks like plastic, has fine details showing the company name or other designs, it is in fact a molded treat. Anything this highly compressed is absolutely deadly.While even rawhide carries some of the same risks because it is so durable...it is a MUCH safer alternative to greenies.I am actually surprised amazon even sells this product, and would go as far as suggesting to amazon users to petition them to stop selling it."
"Great product for dogs after their meals (if eating soft food or teething). My Papillion does jumps for joy when I say 'chewy' (what we call them). As some dogs may not like them, buy one package at your vet first (be prepared to pay twice as much!). Honest! I paid over $9 at my vet until I found them here. Good stuff pups!"
I have the fussiest dog in the world. I orginally got these treats from the vet. When I went back for them they were 2X the orginal price . She liked them so mush I found them here for about 1/2 the price of the vet. I don`t know why such a fussy dog likes these cause they stink.
"Product arrived in good shape, seem fresh, but they are smallish (average size?) bags.  Only 14 PB cups per bag.  Just letting you know so you know how many pieces you will recieve (84)."
"If you love Reese's, you will love this.  63 ounces of Reeses for only fifteen dollars is a steal.  But I can't stop eating them, so I may have to buy some more soon..."
"I ordered this multipack of Reeses Peanut Cups for Halloween and it was just right. Six bags of single serve peanut butter cups  ready to pass out to the trick or treaters - plus a couple of extras for snacking on between hordes of kids at the doorstep. These are regular size candies rather than those chintzy tiny ""snack"" size which explains the pricing. I for one, found that a pleasant bonus actually. I will totally buy these again - beats standing in line at the grocery store!"
I found these for $11.70 on amazon.  I freeze them and when the grandchildren come over they go straight for the freezer and grab a few.  I like that they are snack size.
"There isn't anything bad to say here. The product came in very fresh and intact, and come on, it's Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, they're freakin' amazing."
"I've loved these Reese's as far back as I could imagine. Every bite has always been smooth and the combination of peanut butter and chocolate makes me drool just as I am typing this. If you haven't tried Reese's before, do it! If not, enjoy the peanut butter cups every once in a while.Also, the bite sized Reese's makes it easy to enjoy as a ""finger"" snack."
I buy food from amazon all. the. time. and have never had anything bad come from them.  Until this... of course it had to be the yumminess of a PB cup.  But yes.  All of them were deformed and melted and the inside was more of a dry consistancy than a PBery one.
On of my all time Amazon favorite. Just foe info these are the smaller treat sized cups. Package came quick and as ordered.
"I was tired of getting bags of assorted chocolate candy that always had a variety no one would eat.  I love that amazon was selling this product and it came in ""bulk"".  I won't run out of the office candy again!  I went ahead and bought all of the favorite brands so I can keep everyone happy."
Great tasting as always!  I treat myself every other day and love it...  I'll be buying more when I run out...
There is nothing to complain about these PB cups. You get 6 bags for Halloween for a good price and you have leftovers for the family to eat. I hope next Halloween they will offer this product with the rebate once again! Thanks Amazon!
"Revived promptly in excellent condition at a great price, what's not to love about the chocolaty, peanut butter goodness of Reese's?"
"I THOUGHT I'D BUY MY HALLOWEEN CANDY ON AMAZON THIS YEAR.  I BOUGHT THIS TIMES 2 SO I WAS COUNTING 6 BAGS TIMES 2= 12.  EACH BAG WAS SUPPOSE TO HAVE APPROXIMATE 19 PER BAG SO 12 TIMES 19= 228.  I USUALLY GET A LITTLE OVER 100 KIDS, I'D GIVE 2 TO EACH PERSON=200 PLUS SOME EXTRAS.  ACTUALLY GOT 14 IN EACH BAG 14 TIMES 12= 168.  THAT MAKES ME SHORT BY 32 PLUS NO EXTRAS.  NOW I HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY MORE HALLOWEEN  CANDY.  I KNOW IT SAID APPROXIMATE 19 BUT 14 IS A BIG DIFFERENCE."
"We all know the product, the problem here was the packaging. They arrived having been melted and hardened again. Each candy was no longer a cup shape but a bag of abstract shapes, nothing like their oringinal form. They were ordered to be favors for a wedding. Labels had been bought with the newleyweds monogram in the shape of the pb cup. What a disaster!"
"Amazon advertises this with their Halloween specials, however, despite the fact that I ordered it on Oct. 20, the shipment confirmation indicates I will not receive it until sometime between Nov. 15-30. Maybe it should be advertised as a Thanksgiving or Christmas special instead. I had difficulty rating it because I'm guessing the product will be the usual great taste of Reese's PBC but I'd rate Amazon a zero on the false advertising & delivery."
"once again I purchased this candy to relive a childhood memory only to find that I could not eat this type of chocolate anymore, I had to give it away.I wont be purchasing this product again."
This used to be a good buy a few months ago when they were $7.16 for a pack of 4. But the current asking price of $13.92 is almost twice as high as in my local Target.
"Fruity pebbles are awesome. These were really cheap when I got them, and they came with a bonus Fruity Pebbles rice crispy treat. The only downside is that I can eat an entire box in one sitting. Also I lost my left foot to diabetes after finishing this 4 pack. But hey, that's why god gave us two feet, right?"
each box was less than 1.00 and one of my kids favorite cereals.....keep the deals coming and I will keep coming back...Thank you!
The 4 boxes come in 4 separate boxes which is great because usually the bundles come in bags and Fruity Pebbles are tasty.
"I've purchased cereal from Amazon before, but I didn't even think that some of my favorites would be sold here. Fruity Pebbles is perhaps my most favorite. Lucky Charms and Cocoa Pebbles are a close second. I love the fruity taste of this cereal, although this processed garbage could be a whole lot healthier. It seems like the price fluctuates up and down, so I will wait until this 4-pack drops lower than $14.55."
"I first bought this at the price of 7.68 for 4 boxes with free super saver shipping...it is very good cereal but 14 dollars as price is now, is crazy and a RIPOFF!"
"It's four boxes of Pebbles...Have you had Pebbles? Then you know what you are getting into. Candy cereal, probably terribly unhealthy. But for under $2 as box its a steal."
I bought this deal when I was feeling to lazy to go to the store and buy cereal... It came all speedy like and made me a happy camper. Also - $2.00 a box is a great deal (unless you're willing to put the time into ad-matching/couponing)
WOW! Not much to say. Its cereal just as if it is on the shelfs at stores but at a way cheaper price. I love these since I was a child and still eat them to this day. Got to love em'.
"Well, it's fruity pebbles- obviously it's awesome. I had bought it for around $7 shipped, which was an amazing deal for 4 boxes, can't get any better than that."
Arrived properly packed and a great charm for boys.they are not so sweet which is good.Thank you for easy shopping!
"I saw this as a great deal on cereal that beat my local grocery store. It's Fruity Pebbles, the same taste but in bulk! Great taste, awesome price, you can't go wrong."
"I'm picky about hot sauces and now I have a new favorite!  It's not just heat, but a full flavor that I really, really like.  Put the fresh bottle out with a pot of gumbo and everyone at the table really poured this stuff on.  Ordering a bunch of bottles now."
